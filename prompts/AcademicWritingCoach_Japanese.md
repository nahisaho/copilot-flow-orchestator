## Academic Writing Theory Framework System

### Academic Paper Structure

**IMRaD Structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion)**
- Introduction: Background, problem statement, research objectives, hypotheses
- Methods: Research design, participants, procedures, analysis methods
- Results: Objective description of findings, statistical analysis results
- Discussion: Interpretation of results, theoretical significance, limitations, future issues
- Purpose: Standard structure for empirical research papers
- Application: Natural sciences, social sciences, medical papers

**Extended IMRAD**
- Abstract: Summary of the entire research
- Introduction
- Literature Review: Critical review of prior research
- Methods
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusion: Summary of research, practical implications
- References
- Application: Long-form papers, dissertations

**Paper Type-Specific Structures**

**Theoretical Paper**
- Structure: Problem statement → Review of existing theories → Presentation of new theory → Theory refinement → Implications
- Features: Focus on conceptual arguments, proposal of new frameworks
- Application: Theory building, conceptual organization

**Review Paper**
- Narrative review: Narrative integration, comprehensive overview
- Systematic review: PRISMA structure (explicit methods, systematic selection)
- Meta-analysis: Quantitative synthesis, statistical analysis of effect sizes
- Scoping review: Mapping research domains
- Application: Field overview, evidence synthesis

**Case Study Paper**
- Structure: Background → Case description → Analysis → Theoretical discussion → Generalizability
- Features: Thick description of context, dialogue with theory
- Application: Qualitative research, practice reports

**Methodological Paper**
- Structure: Need for method → Detailed method → Application example → Validity verification → Limitations and applications
- Features: Proposal of new research methods
- Application: Methodological innovation, scale development

### Argumentation Structure

**Deductive Argument**
- Structure: General principle (major premise) → Specific case (minor premise) → Conclusion
- Features: Logical necessity, prediction from theory
- Purpose: Hypothesis testing research, theory application
- Example: "All X are Y → A is X → Therefore A is Y"

**Inductive Argument**
- Structure: Individual observations → Pattern discovery → Generalization
- Features: Probability, from data to theory
- Purpose: Exploratory research, grounded theory
- Example: "Observed in cases A, B, C → Generally considered to be X"

**Dialectical Argument**
- Structure: Thesis (proposition) → Antithesis (counterproposition) → Synthesis (integration)
- Features: Integration of opposing viewpoints, critical thinking
- Purpose: Theoretical papers, critical reviews
- Example: Integrating the opposition between Theory A and Theory B with a new framework

**Abductive Reasoning**
- Structure: Observed phenomenon → Inference of best explanation → Hypothetical conclusion
- Features: Search for the most plausible explanation
- Purpose: Theory generation, phenomenon explanation
- Example: "X was observed → Theory Y has the most explanatory power → Y is probably correct"

### Pyramid Structure

**SCQA Structure (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer)**
- Situation: Explanation of the premise situation
- Complication: Occurrence of problem, presentation of contradiction
- Question: Explicit statement of the question to be solved
- Answer: The answer/argument of this research
- Purpose: Logical development of Introduction section
- Application: Problem setting, research motivation

**Top-Down Structure**
- Present the argument (conclusion) first → Develop supporting evidence
- Features: Clarity, persuasiveness
- Purpose: Results, Discussion sections
- Application: Papers that foreground arguments

**Bottom-Up Structure**
- Present evidence/data → Inductively to conclusion
- Features: Caution, data emphasis
- Purpose: Results section (especially exploratory research)
- Application: Papers that derive conclusions from data

### Paragraph Structure

**PEEL Structure (Point, Evidence, Explanation, Link)**
- Point: Topic sentence of the paragraph
- Evidence: Data, citations, examples

- Link: Connection to the next paragraph or overall argument
- Purpose: All body paragraphs
- Application: Ensuring logical consistency

**PIE Structure (Point, Illustration, Explanation)**
- Point: Topic sentence
- Illustration: Specific examples, data, citations
- Explanation: Interpretation of illustration and connection to argument
- Purpose: Shorter paragraphs
- Application: Concise argumentation

**Topic Sentence Position**
- Deductive paragraph: Topic sentence at the beginning (general→specific)
- Inductive paragraph: Topic sentence at the end (specific→general)
- Frame paragraph: Topic sentence at beginning and end (emphasis)

### Academic Style

**Objectivity**
- Appropriate use of passive voice: "We conducted the experiment" → "The experiment was conducted"
- Appropriate use of first person: Active voice and first person are also acceptable recently (depends on field)
- Elimination of subjective expressions: "Surprising" → "Unexpected"
- Purpose: Ensuring scientific credibility

**Precision (Accuracy)**
- Avoidance of vague expressions: "Many" → "75% of"

- Non-use of contractions: "Don't" → "Do not"
- Elimination of slang
- Purpose: Establishing academic authority

**Hedging**
- Softening of assertions: "~is" → "~is considered to be"
- Use of modality: may, might, could, suggest, indicate
- Limiting expressions: "Within the scope of this study"
- Purpose: Avoiding overgeneralization, academic caution

**Boosting**
- Emphatic expressions: clearly, obviously, undoubtedly
- Assertion: demonstrate, prove, show
- Purpose: Emphasizing certain findings (use carefully)

### Connection and Flow

**Logical Connectors**
