## Academic Writing Theory Framework System
### Academic Paper Structure

**IMRaD Structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion)**
- Introduction: Background, problem statement, research objectives, hypotheses、Methods: Research design, participants, procedures, analysis methods、Results: Objective description of findings, statistical analysis results
- Discussion: Interpretation of results, theoretical significance, limitations, future issues
- Purpose: Standard structure for empirical research papers
- Application: Natural sciences, social sciences, medical papers

**Extended IMRAD**
- Abstract: Summary of the entire research、Introduction、Literature Review: Critical review of prior research
- Methods
- Results、Discussion、Conclusion: Summary of research, practical implications
- References、Application: Long-form papers, dissertations

**Paper Type-Specific Structures**

**Theoretical Paper**
- Structure: Problem statement Review of existing theories Presentation of new theory Theory refinement Implications、Features: Focus on conceptual arguments, proposal of new frameworks、Application: Theory building, conceptual organization

**Review Paper**
- Narrative review: Narrative integration, comprehensive overview、Systematic review: PRISMA structure (explicit methods, systematic selection)、Meta-analysis: Quantitative synthesis, statistical analysis of effect sizes
- Scoping review: Mapping research domains、Application: Field overview, evidence synthesis

**Case Study Paper**
- Structure: Background Case description Analysis Theoretical discussion Generalizability、Features: Thick description of context, dialogue with theory、Application: Qualitative research, practice reports

**Methodological Paper**
- Structure: Need for method Detailed method Application example Validity verification Limitations and applications、Features: Proposal of new research methods、Application: Methodological innovation, scale development

### Argumentation Structure

**Deductive Argument**
- Structure: General principle (major premise) Specific case (minor premise) Conclusion、Features: Logical necessity, prediction from theory、Purpose: Hypothesis testing research, theory application
- Example: "All X are Y A is X Therefore A is Y"

**Inductive Argument**
- Structure: Individual observations Pattern discovery Generalization、Features: Probability, from data to theory、Purpose: Exploratory research, grounded theory
- Example: "Observed in cases A, B, C Generally considered to be X"

**Dialectical Argument**
- Structure: Thesis (proposition) Antithesis (counterproposition) Synthesis (integration)、Features: Integration of opposing viewpoints, critical thinking、Purpose: Theoretical papers, critical reviews
- Example: Integrating the opposition between Theory A and Theory B with a new framework

**Abductive Reasoning**
- Structure: Observed phenomenon Inference of best explanation Hypothetical conclusion、Features: Search for the most plausible explanation、Purpose: Theory generation, phenomenon explanation
- Example: "X was observed Theory Y has the most explanatory power Y is probably correct"

### Pyramid Structure

**SCQA Structure (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer)**
- Situation: Explanation of the premise situation、Complication: Occurrence of problem, presentation of contradiction、Question: Explicit statement of the question to be solved
- Answer: The answer/argument of this research、Purpose: Logical development of Introduction section、Application: Problem setting, research motivation

**Top-Down Structure**
- Present the argument (conclusion) first Develop supporting evidence、Features: Clarity, persuasiveness、Purpose: Results, Discussion sections
- Application: Papers that foreground arguments

**Bottom-Up Structure**
- Present evidence/data Inductively to conclusion、Features: Caution, data emphasis、Purpose: Results section (especially exploratory research)
- Application: Papers that derive conclusions from data

### Paragraph Structure

**PEEL Structure (Point, Evidence, Explanation, Link)**
- Point: Topic sentence of the paragraph、Evidence: Data, citations, examples、Explanation: Interpretation of evidence, explanation of significance
- Link: Connection to the next paragraph or overall argument
- Purpose: All body paragraphs、Application: Ensuring logical consistency

**PIE Structure (Point, Illustration, Explanation)**
- Point: Topic sentence、Illustration: Specific examples, data, citations、Explanation: Interpretation of illustration and connection to argument
- Purpose: Shorter paragraphs、Application: Concise argumentation

**Topic Sentence Position**
- Deductive paragraph: Topic sentence at the beginning (generalspecific)、Inductive paragraph: Topic sentence at the end (specificgeneral)、Frame paragraph: Topic sentence at beginning and end (emphasis)

### Academic Style

**Objectivity**
- Appropriate use of passive voice: "We conducted the experiment" "The experiment was conducted"、Appropriate use of first person: Active voice and first person are also acceptable recently (depends on field)、Elimination of subjective expressions: "Surprising" "Unexpected"
- Purpose: Ensuring scientific credibility

**Precision (Accuracy)**
- Avoidance of vague expressions: "Many" "75% of"、Use of appropriate technical terms、Clarification of definitions
- Purpose: Ensuring reproducibility

**Conciseness**
- Deletion of redundant expressions: "The fact that~" "~is"、Avoidance of nominalization: "Implementation of improvement" "Improve"、Deletion of unnecessary modifiers
- Purpose: Improving readability

**Formality**
- Avoidance of colloquial expressions: "Very much" "Significantly"、Non-use of contractions: "Don't" "Do not"、Elimination of slang
- Purpose: Establishing academic authority

**Hedging**
- Softening of assertions: "~is" "~is considered to be"、Use of modality: may, might, could, suggest, indicate、Limiting expressions: "Within the scope of this study"
- Purpose: Avoiding overgeneralization, academic caution

**Boosting**
- Emphatic expressions: clearly, obviously, undoubtedly、Assertion: demonstrate, prove, show、Purpose: Emphasizing certain findings (use carefully)

### Connection and Flow

**Logical Connectors**
- Addition: furthermore, moreover, in addition, additionally、Contrast: however, nevertheless, in contrast, whereas、Causality: therefore, thus, consequently, as a result
- Exemplification: for example, for instance, such as, specifically
- Summary: in summary, in conclusion, overall, in short

**Pronouns and Anaphora**
- Forward reference: this study, these findings, the aforementioned、Backward reference: the following, as discussed below、Purpose: Text cohesion

**Topic Continuity**
- Given-New structure: Placement of known information (Given) new information (New)、Theme progression patterns: Continuous type, branching type, concentrated type、Purpose: Optimizing information flow

### Citation and Reference

**Types of Citations**
- Direct quotation: Quote original text as is (enclosed in "")、Indirect quotation: Paraphrase in your own words、Summary: Concisely summarize key points

**Citation Integration**
- Integral: Smith (2020) argues that...、Non-integral: Previous research shows... (Smith, 2020)

**Functions of Citations**
- Authorization, evidence presentation, positioning with prior research, critical examination

**Citation Styles**
- APA Style: Author-year system (psychology, education, social sciences)、MLA Style: Author-page system (humanities)、Chicago Style: Footnote system (history)
