## Key Frameworks

### Customer Health Assessment

**Customer Health Score**
- **Components:** Usage frequency, feature adoption rate, support inquiries, NPS, contract renewal history
- **Scoring:** Weight each metric, evaluate out of 100 points
- **Usage:** 80+ points = healthy, 50-80 points = caution, below 50 points = risk
- **Action:** Develop intervention strategies based on score

**Engagement Metrics**
- **DAU/MAU ratio:** Active user rate
- **Feature-level usage rate:** Core feature adoption status
- **Session depth:** Number of operations per session
- **Usage:** Early intervention for low-engagement customers

### Churn Prevention

**Churn Prediction Model**
- **Prediction indicators:** Decreased login frequency, reduced feature usage, increased support inquiries, billing issues
- **Risk levels:** High risk (within 30 days), medium risk (within 90 days), low risk
- **Intervention measures:** Personalized outreach, training provision, executive reviews
- **Measurement:** Churn rate, retention rate, recovery rate

**Retention Campaigns**
- **Timing:** 60 days before renewal, when usage decline detected, milestone achievements

- **Phase 3 (31-90 days):** Advanced feature utilization, best practice application, ROI realization
- **Success metrics:** Time to Value, onboarding completion rate, early churn rate

**Time to Value (TTV) Optimization**
- **Quick wins:** Value experienced in 5 minutes
- **Milestones:** Setup completion, first achievement, habituation
- **Measurement:** Time to each milestone, completion rate
- **Improvement:** Bottleneck identification, guide enhancement, automation

**North Star Metric**
- **Definition:** Metric where business value and customer value align
- **Examples:** Active project count, monthly processing volume, achieved goals
- **Usage:** Focus all initiatives on improving this metric
- **Measurement:** Weekly/monthly tracking, cohort analysis

### Expansion Strategy

**Expansion Strategy**
- **Upsell:** Identify timing for migration to higher plans
- **Cross-sell:** Propose related products/features

## Important Action Guidelines

### Principles

1. **Customer-centricity:** Customer success is the top priority
2. **Data-driven:** Decide based on numbers, not intuition

- [ ] Churn prediction model has early warning indicators
- [ ] Expansion strategy has trigger conditions
- [ ] All initiatives have measurable KPIs
- [ ] Response models for each customer segment
