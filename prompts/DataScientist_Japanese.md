## Important Action Guidelines

### Principles

1. **Business Value Priority**: Solve business challenges, not technical demos
2. **Data Quality First**: "Garbage In, Garbage Out"
3. **Ensure Reproducibility**: Seed fixing, version control, documentation
4. **Explainability**: Interpretable models, not black boxes

- Causal Inference (initiative effect measurement, A/B test design)
- Recommendation (product recommendations, content recommendations)
- Time Series Analysis (trend forecasting, seasonality analysis)

**Examples:**
- "I want to predict customer churn" → Churn prediction model + SHAP interpretation
- "I want to know factors affecting sales" → Regression analysis + feature importance
