## Financial Theory Framework System

### Financial Statement Analysis

**Three Financial Statements**
- Balance Sheet (B/S): Financial position, assets/liabilities/equity
- Income Statement (P/L): Business performance, revenues/expenses/profits
- Cash Flow Statement (C/F): Cash changes, operating/investing/financing CF
- Purpose: Comprehensive understanding of corporate financial health

**Financial Ratio Analysis**

**Profitability Ratios**
- Gross Profit Margin: (Gross Profit / Sales) × 100
- Operating Profit Margin: (Operating Profit / Sales) × 100
- Net Profit Margin: (Net Profit / Sales) × 100
- Return on Assets (ROA): (Net Profit / Total Assets) × 100
- Return on Equity (ROE): (Net Profit / Equity) × 100
- Return on Invested Capital (ROIC): (NOPAT / Invested Capital) × 100

**Efficiency Ratios**
- Total Asset Turnover: Sales / Total Assets
- Fixed Asset Turnover: Sales / Fixed Assets
- Inventory Turnover: Cost of Goods Sold / Inventory
- Receivables Days: (Accounts Receivable + Notes Receivable) / (Sales / 365)
- Payables Days: (Accounts Payable + Notes Payable) / (COGS / 365)

**Safety Ratios**
- Current Ratio: (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) × 100 [Target: 200%+]
- Quick Ratio: (Quick Assets / Current Liabilities) × 100 [Target: 100%+]
- Equity Ratio: (Equity / Total Assets) × 100 [Target: 40%+]
- Interest Coverage Ratio: Operating Profit / Interest Expense [Target: 10x+]

**Growth Ratios**
- Sales Growth Rate: (Current Sales - Previous Sales) / Previous Sales × 100
- Operating Profit Growth Rate: (Current OP - Previous OP) / Previous OP × 100
- CAGR: ((Final Year / Initial Year)^(1/Years) - 1) × 100

**DuPont Analysis**
- ROE Decomposition: ROE = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage
- Purpose: Identify ROE sources and improvement points

**Trend Analysis**
- Horizontal Analysis: Change rate from base year
- Vertical Analysis: Composition ratio analysis
- Time-series Comparison: Multi-year trend analysis

**Peer Comparison**
- Benchmarking: Comparison with industry averages
- Competitive Analysis: Financial metric comparison with key competitors

### Corporate Valuation

**DCF Method (Discounted Cash Flow)**
- Theory: Sum of present value of future cash flows
- Process: FCF forecast → WACC calculation → Present value calculation → Terminal value
- WACC: (Cost of Equity × Equity Ratio) + (Cost of Debt × (1-Tax Rate) × Debt Ratio)
- Purpose: Intrinsic value evaluation, M&A, investment decisions

**Multiple Method**
- P/E: Stock Price / Earnings Per Share
- P/B: Stock Price / Book Value Per Share
- EV/EBITDA: Enterprise Value / EBITDA
- Purpose: Market-based relative valuation

**Asset-Based Valuation**
- Book value method, fair value method, liquidation value method
- Purpose: Asset-intensive companies, private company valuation

**EVA (Economic Value Added)**
- EVA = NOPAT - (Invested Capital × WACC)
- Purpose: Economic value-added measurement

### Capital Structure Theory

**Modigliani-Miller Theorem**
- Proposition I (with taxes): Tax shield from debt increases firm value
- Purpose: Theoretical foundation for optimal capital structure

**Trade-Off Theory**
- Theory: Balance between tax benefits vs. financial distress costs
- Optimal Debt Ratio: Marginal tax benefit = Marginal financial distress cost

**Pecking Order Theory**
- Priority: Retained earnings > Debt > Equity issuance
- Theory: External financing has costs due to information asymmetry

**Financial Leverage Effect**
- Positive Leverage: ROA > Cost of Debt → ROE increases
- Negative Leverage: ROA < Cost of Debt → ROE decreases

### Cost of Capital

**Cost of Equity**
- CAPM: Risk-Free Rate + β × Market Risk Premium
- Dividend Discount Model: (Next Dividend / Stock Price) + Dividend Growth Rate

**Cost of Debt**
- After-Tax Cost of Debt: Cost of Debt × (1 - Effective Tax Rate)

**WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital)**
- Purpose: Discount rate for investment decisions, minimum required return

### Investment Evaluation

**NPV (Net Present Value)**
- NPV = Σ(Cash Flow per Period / (1+Discount Rate)^n) - Initial Investment
- Decision Criteria: Execute investment if NPV > 0

**IRR (Internal Rate of Return)**
- Definition: Discount rate where NPV = 0
- Decision Criteria: Execute investment if IRR > WACC

**Payback Period Method**
- Definition: Period to recover initial investment
- Purpose: Simple judgment, risk assessment

**Profitability Index (PI)**
- PI = Present Value of Cash Flows / Initial Investment
- Decision Criteria: Execute investment if PI > 1

**Sensitivity / Scenario Analysis**
- Analysis of how changes in key variables affect NPV/IRR
- Evaluation under optimistic/base/pessimistic scenarios

### Working Capital Management

**Working Capital**
- Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
- Purpose: Day-to-day cash management

**CCC (Cash Conversion Cycle)**
- CCC = Receivables Days + Inventory Days - Payables Days
- Shortening strategies: Earlier collection, inventory reduction, payment extension

**Cash Flow Management**
- Cash Flow Statement: Budget vs. actual revenue/expenditure management
- Short-term Financial Planning: Monthly/weekly level

### Financing

**Equity Financing**
- Common stock issuance, preferred stock, stock options
- Advantages: No repayment, improved financial safety
- Disadvantages: Dilution, dividend burden

**Debt Financing**
- Bank loans, bond issuance, syndicated loans
- Advantages: Tax shield, no dilution
- Disadvantages: Repayment obligation, financial covenants

**Mezzanine Financing**
- Subordinated debt, preferred stock, convertible bonds
- Purpose: LBO, growth capital

**Asset-Based Financing**
- Factoring, ABL, leasing, sale-leaseback
- Purpose: Working capital, off-balance sheet

**Project Finance**
- Non-recourse loans, SPV
- Purpose: Infrastructure, large development projects

### Dividend Policy

**Dividend Policy Theories**
- M&M Theory: In perfect markets, dividend policy is irrelevant to firm value
- Signaling Theory: Dividends signal future prospects

**Dividend Payout Ratio**
- Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividends / Net Profit × 100
- Target Payout Ratio: 30-50% is common

**Dividend Yield**
- Dividend Yield = Dividend Per Share / Stock Price × 100

**Share Buybacks**
- Advantages: Flexibility, EPS improvement, tax efficiency
- Purpose: Shareholder returns, capital structure optimization

**Progressive Dividend Policy**
- Policy: No dividend cuts, increase or maintain
- Advantages: Shareholder trust, stock price stability

### M&A Financial Analysis

**Acquisition Price Calculation**
- Enterprise Value (EV): DCF method, multiple method
- Equity Value: Enterprise Value - Net Debt

**Synergy Analysis**
- Cost Synergy: Duplicate cost reduction, economies of scale
- Revenue Synergy: Cross-selling, market expansion
- Financial Synergy: Tax benefits, lower cost of capital

**Due Diligence**
- Financial DD: Financial statement review, off-balance sheet liabilities
- Business DD: Business viability, market, competition
- Legal DD: Contracts, litigation, intellectual property

**LBO (Leveraged Buyout)**
- Structure: Acquisition using substantial debt
- LBO Model: CF forecast, debt repayment plan, IRR calculation

**PPA (Purchase Price Allocation)**
- Goodwill: Acquisition Price - Fair Value of Net Assets
- Impairment Test: Goodwill impairment determination

### Risk Management

**Financial Risks**

- Receivables Management: Collection management, early response to overdue receivables

### Performance Measurement

**KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**
- Financial KPIs: Sales, operating margin, ROE, ROIC, FCF
- Balanced Scorecard: Four perspectives - financial, customer, process, learning

**EBITDA**
- Definition: Operating Profit + Depreciation
- Purpose: Cash generation capacity assessment

**Capital Efficiency Metrics**
- ROIC, ROCE
