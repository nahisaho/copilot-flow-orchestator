## Kakenhi Application Framework System
### Research Planning Systems

**Logic Model**
- Elements: Input (resources) Activity (activities) Output (products) Outcome (impact)、Purpose: Logical consistency check of research plan, evaluation indicator setting、Template: Input (research funds/period/equipment/team) / Activity (annual activities) / Output (papers/data/methods) / Outcome (short-term/medium-term/long-term impact)
- Application: Visualize causal relationships of entire research, demonstrate feasibility to reviewers

**SMART Goal Setting**
- Elements: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound、Purpose: Clarifying annual goals, setting progress evaluation criteria、Template: Set goals by SMART criteria for each year (e.g., 2 peer-reviewed papers in Year 1, collect 500 data points, complete by end of March)
- Application: Convert vague plans into specific, measurable goals

**Gantt Chart (Research Schedule)**
- Elements: Task breakdown, timeline arrangement, milestones, dependencies、Purpose: Proof of research feasibility, presentation of time allocation validity、Template: Visualize tasks by month/quarter, clearly indicate sequence of pilot experiment data collection analysis paper writing
- Application: Visually demonstrate feasibility within limited research period

**Research Question Setting (5W1H)**
- Elements: What, Why, Who, When, Where, How、Purpose: Clarifying research questions, specifying research scope、Template: Clearly describe "whose", "what problem", "why it should be solved", "how to solve it"
- Application: Convert vague research themes into clear research questions

**Risk Management & Contingency Plan**
- Elements: Anticipated risks, probability, impact, alternative measures、Purpose: Ensuring research feasibility, dispelling reviewer concerns、Template: Risk item (e.g., difficulty in data collection) / Probability (medium) / Impact (large) / Alternative (alternative survey method)
- Application: Appeal research execution capability and planning

### Originality and Significance Explanation Systems

**Three Categories of Academic Originality**
- Elements: Priority (world's first), Originality (new approach), Innovation (paradigm shift)、Purpose: Clearly articulate originality, address review criteria、Template: Specify which category your research falls into (multiple applicable)
- Application: Concretely explain "originality"

**Dual-Axis Evaluation of Academic and Social Significance**
- Elements: Academic significance (theoretical contribution, methodological innovation, new findings), Social significance (practical application, policy recommendations, social problem solving)、Purpose: Explain research value from multiple perspectives、Template: Describe both academic significance (contribution to the field) / social significance (return to society)
- Application: Basic research also shows social significance, applied research also shows academic significance

**SCQA Structure (Storytelling)**
- Elements: Situation Complication Question Answer、Purpose: Logical explanation of research background and objectives、Template: S "Currently, the situation is~" / C "However, there is a problem of~" / Q "Then, how can we~?" / A "This research clarifies~"
- Application: Structure research background as a persuasive narrative

**Positioning Matrix with Prior Research**
- Elements: Position prior research and your own research on 2 axes (e.g., Approach × Target)、Purpose: Visualizing research gaps, making originality explicit、Template: Matrix with vertical axis (method) × horizontal axis (target), position your research in blank area of existing research
- Application: Visually demonstrate "why this research is needed"

### Writing Structure and Logic Development Systems

**PREP Method**
- Elements: Point (conclusion) Reason Example Point (restatement of conclusion)、Purpose: Concise and clear sentence structure、Template: Start with conclusion, then grounds, reinforce with specific examples, reconfirm conclusion at end
- Application: Description of research objectives, research significance, expected outcomes

**Pyramid Structure**
- Elements: Hierarchical structure of argument evidence 1/2/3、Purpose: Logical and persuasive sentence structure、Template: Main argument at top, three supporting evidences below, details of each evidence further down
- Application: Explanation of research originality and importance

### Evaluation and Review Systems

**Peer Review Perspective Checklist**
- Elements: 15 items (research objective clarity, prior research review adequacy, methodology validity, feasibility, originality, ethical considerations, budget validity, etc.)、Purpose: Self-inspection of proposal, quality assurance、Template: Rate each item on 5-point scale, improve items rated 3 or below
- Application: Final check before submission

**Review Criteria Correspondence Matrix**
- Elements: Correspondence between JSPS review criteria 5 items (academic importance, originality, research plan validity, execution capability, universality) and each section of proposal、Purpose: Ensuring complete correspondence to review criteria、Template: Matrix of review criteria × proposal sections to specify corresponding locations
- Application: Reliably include information reviewers seek

**Feasibility Evaluation Matrix**
- Elements: Technical feasibility, resources (budget/equipment/personnel), period, risk、Purpose: Proof of research execution capability、Template: Evaluate each element as high/medium/low, describe countermeasures for medium/low items
- Application: Description of pilot experiment results, research achievements, research environment

### Budget Planning Systems

**Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**
- Elements: Budget items, amount, expected outcomes, cost-effectiveness、Purpose: Explaining budget validity、Template: Link equipment costs/travel expenses/personnel costs with outcomes (number of papers/amount of data)
- Application: Convince reviewers "this budget is appropriate"

**Annual Budget Allocation Plan**
- Elements: Activity content and corresponding budget for each year、Purpose: Consistency between research plan and budget、Template: Link major activities and necessary expenses by year
- Application: Demonstrate consistency between Gantt chart and budget

## Dialogue Process
### Phase 1: Understanding Application Information and Goals

2. Understand current status of research (idea stage, pilot experiments completed, continuing research, etc.)
4. Propose 3-5 optimal frameworks

### Phase 2: Presenting Creation Plan

### Phase 3: Structured Dialogue for Proposal Creation

### Phase 4: Proposal Completion and Quality Check

2. Quality evaluation with peer review checklist
3. Check for omissions with review criteria correspondence matrix
