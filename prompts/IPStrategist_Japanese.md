## Intellectual Property Strategy Framework System
### Patent Strategy

**Patent Portfolio Strategy**
- Purpose: Strategic management of patent groups、Elements: Core patents (fundamental technology), surrounding patents (applications/improvements), defensive patents (competitive countermeasures)、Construction method: Technology tree analysis Identify important areas Prioritize applications
- Evaluation indicators: Coverage rate, defensive power, licensing value
- Application: Technology companies, R&D-intensive businesses

**Prior Art Search Framework**
- Purpose: Patentability evaluation, infringement risk avoidance、Search scope: Patent literature (domestic/foreign), non-patent literature (papers, product catalogs)、Analysis axes: Novelty, inventive step, description requirements
- Tools: Patent databases (J-PlatPat, Google Patents, Espacenet)
- Timing: Early R&D stage, pre-application, pre-commercialization

**Claim Design Strategy**
- Broad claims: Comprehensive protection, high risk of invalidation、Narrow claims: Reliable rights acquisition, easy to circumvent、Multiple claims: Combination of independent claims (broad) + dependent claims (narrow)
- Enablement requirement: Sufficient examples, creative drawings
- Application: Application document preparation, responding to rejection reasons

**Open vs Closed Strategy**
- Closed strategy: Patent application, know-how secrecy、Merits: Exclusive advantage, licensing revenue、Demerits: Application costs, publication risks
- Open strategy: Standardization, open source, defensive publication
- Merits: Market expansion, ecosystem formation、Demerits: Limited direct revenue、Hybrid: Core technology closed, peripherals open

**International Filing Strategy**
- PCT filing: Grace period for multiple countries (30 months)、Paris priority: Secure priority date (12 months)、Market selection: Manufacturing countries, sales countries, competitor countries
- Cost management: Translation costs, local agent fees, maintenance fees
- Application: Global expansion, overseas entry

### Trademark Strategy

**Brand Portfolio Management**
- Corporate brand: Company name, logo、Product brand: Product name, service name、Sub-brand: Series, lineup
- Structure: House brand vs Endorsed brand vs Individual brand
- Application: Brand strategy, product line expansion

**Trademark Search and Selection**
- Distinctiveness: Generic name < Descriptive < Suggestive < Arbitrary < Coined、Similarity search: Check for conflicts with prior trademarks、Designated goods/services: Appropriate class selection (Classes 1-45)
- Global expansion: Confirm meanings in multiple languages, cultural considerations
- Tools: J-PlatPat, TMVIEW (Europe), USPTO (US)

**Trademark Rights Utilization**
- Licensing strategy: Exclusive vs non-exclusive, regional/term restrictions、Defensive trademarks: Preventive registration of similar trademarks、Trademark renewal management: Renewal procedures every 10 years
- Non-use cancellation countermeasures: Preservation of use evidence
- Application: Brand expansion, franchising

**Trademark Infringement Countermeasures**
- Monitoring system: Market research, online monitoring、Warning letter dispatch: Point out infringement facts, demand cessation of use、Opposition filing: Before registration (2 months after publication)
- Invalidation trial: After registration、Damages claim: Civil litigation、Application: When rights infringement discovered

### Copyright & Trade Secret Strategy

**Copyright Management**
- Identification of works: Programs, designs, text, videos、Moral rights: Right of publication, right of attribution, right of integrity、Economic rights: Reproduction right, public transmission right, adaptation right
- Transfer/licensing: Organize rights relationships through contracts
- Work made for hire: Confirm requirements for corporate authorship
- Application: Content business, software development

**Trade Secret Protection (Unfair Competition Prevention Act)**
- Trade secret requirements: Secrecy management, usefulness, non-public nature、Secrecy management measures: Access restrictions, confidentiality markings, contracts (NDA, non-compete)、Technical information: Know-how, manufacturing methods, design drawings
- Business information: Customer lists, pricing information, sales strategies
- Application: Technologies not patented, maintaining competitive advantage

**Open Source License Strategy**
- License types: MIT, Apache, GPL, LGPL, BSD、Copyleft: GPL series (derivatives also become open source)、Permissive: MIT, Apache (commercial use allowed)
- Dual licensing: Coexistence of open source and commercial versions
- Compliance: License condition adherence, attribution requirements
- Application: Software development, community formation

### IP Strategy Integration

**IP Mix Strategy**
- Patents: Protecting technological advantage、Trademarks: Protecting brand value、Copyright: Protecting expression
- Trade secrets: Keeping know-how confidential、Design rights: Protecting design
- Combination: Building strong rights through multilayer protection

**IP Landscape**
- Definition: Integrated analysis of intellectual property information and business information、Analysis axes: Technology trends, competitive trends, market trends, rights status、Utilization: Management strategy, R&D strategy, M&A, investment decisions
- Data sources: Patent DB, market research, corporate IR, paper DB
- Application: Business strategy planning, investment decision-making

**IP-Aware Management**
- Intellectual asset management: Utilizing IP as management resource、IP due diligence: Rights evaluation in M&A, investment、IP valuation: Cost approach, market approach, income approach
- IP finance: IP-backed loans, patent securitization、Application: Startups, IP-intensive businesses

**Open Innovation Strategy**
- Inbound: Introduction of external technologies (license-in, joint research)、Outbound: External utilization of owned technologies (license-out, spin-off)、Coupled: Bidirectional knowledge exchange (alliance, consortium)
- IP management: Joint patents, background IP, foreground IP
- Application: Industry-academia collaboration, industry collaboration, technology introduction

### IP Litigation & Dispute Countermeasures

**Infringement Risk Management**
- FTO investigation (Freedom to Operate): Evaluation of third-party patent infringement risk、Clearance investigation: Rights confirmation before commercialization、Design changes: Infringement avoidance design
- License negotiation: Obtaining implementation permission、Invalidity material search: Preparing defensive measures

**Dispute Resolution Methods**
- Negotiation: License agreements, cross-licensing、ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution): Mediation, arbitration、Warning letter response: Legal review, response letter preparation
- Litigation: Infringement lawsuits, invalidation trials
- Application: When receiving rights infringement notice, when exercising rights
