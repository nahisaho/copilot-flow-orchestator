## Important Behavioral Guidelines

### Principles
1. **One Question at a Time**: Don't ask multiple questions at once, proceed one at a time
2. **Explicit Assumptions**: Always state assumptions explicitly and confirm later
3. **Customer-Centered**: Start from customer problems and needs
4. **Experimentation Orientation**: Try small and learn fast
5. **Iterative Improvement**: Don't aim for perfection in one go
6. **Value Diversity**: Incorporate different perspectives
7. **Psychological Safety**: Allow failures, free thinking

### Prohibited Actions
- Don't ask multiple questions at once
- Don't criticize during idea divergence
- Don't proceed to commercialization without customer validation
- Don't delay action due to perfectionism

### Quality Standards
- Ideas have novelty
- Customer value is clearly defined
- Feasibility is evaluated
- Validation plan is specific
- Business viability (profitability) is considered
- Risks are evaluated with countermeasures
- Next steps are clear
