## Innovation Promotion Framework System
### Idea Creation Methods

**Design Thinking**
- Phase 1 (Empathize): User observation, interviews, personas、Phase 2 (Define): Insight extraction, POV (Point of View) setting、Phase 3 (Ideate): Brainstorming, idea divergence
- Phase 4 (Prototype): Quick prototyping, low-fidelity mockups
- Phase 5 (Test): User feedback, iterative improvement、Purpose: Customer-centered product/service development、Application: New business, UX improvement, customer problem solving

**SCAMPER Method**
- Substitute: Can something else be substituted?、Combine: Can things be combined?、Adapt: Can it be applied to other uses?
- Modify: Can it be changed, enlarged, or reduced?
- Put to other uses: Are there other ways to use it?、Eliminate: Can something be removed?、Reverse: Can it be reversed?
- Purpose: Improvement of existing products/services, shifting perspectives
- Application: Brainstorming, product improvement

**Brainstorming Techniques**
- Principles: No criticism, freewheeling, quantity over quality, build on ideas、Variations: Mind maps, brainwriting, 6-3-5 method、Facilitation: Timer use, full participation, visualization
- Application: Idea divergence phase

**TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving)**
- Definition: Theory of inventive problem solving、40 Inventive Principles: Segmentation, extraction, local quality, asymmetry, etc.、Technical Contradictions: Resolving trade-offs
- Purpose: Technical problem solving, patent circumvention design
- Application: R&D, engineering

**Analogical Thinking**
- Direct Analogy: Apply cases from other industries、Symbolic Analogy: Ideas from metaphors and symbols、Fantasy Analogy: Imagine ideal state
- Purpose: Breaking conventional wisdom, learning from other industries
- Application: Breaking deadlocks, gaining new perspectives

### Idea Evaluation and Selection

**Idea Evaluation Matrix**
- Axis 1: Feasibility (technology, cost, time)、Axis 2: Impact (market size, profitability, differentiation)、4 Quadrants: Execute immediately, consider, postpone, reject
- Scoring: Point scoring across multiple evaluation axes、Application: Idea prioritization

**ICE Scoring**
- Impact: Magnitude of effect (1-10 points)、Confidence: Certainty of success (1-10 points)、Ease: Ease of implementation (1-10 points)
- Score: (Impact × Confidence × Ease) / 1000、Application: Startups, lean development

**Payoff Matrix**
- Axis 1: Value (customer/business value)、Axis 2: Cost (development effort, investment)、Priority: High value/low cost High value/high cost Low value/low cost
- Application: Selection under resource constraints

**Risk Assessment**
- Technical Risk: Feasibility, technical uncertainty、Market Risk: Customer needs, competition, market size、Execution Risk: Team, resources, time
- Evaluation: Probability × Impact、Countermeasures: Risk mitigation, alternatives、Application: Commercialization decision

### Customer Validation

**Lean Startup**
- Build: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) development、Measure: Customer reactions, data collection、Learn: Validation, pivot decision
- Pivot: Direction change if hypothesis is wrong、Persevere: Continue if hypothesis is correct、Application: New business, startups

**Customer Interviews**
- Purpose: Deep dive into problems/needs, solution validation、Question Techniques: Open questions, 5W1H, Why deep dive、Questions to Avoid: Leading questions, hypothetical questions
- Sample Size: Minimum 10-20 people (by segment)、Application: Problem discovery, solution validation

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Strategy**
- Concierge MVP: Manual value delivery、Landing Page MVP: Demand validation via web page、Prototype MVP: Simplified product
- Wizard of Oz MVP: Manual operation disguised as automation
- Purpose: Hypothesis validation at minimum cost、Application: Initial validation, risk reduction

**Hypothesis Validation Framework**
- Hypothesis Setting: "XX customers have YY problem"、Validation Method: Interviews, surveys, MVP、Success Criteria: Set quantitative pass line
- Result Decision: Pass/fail, next action、Application: Hypothesis-driven development

### Commercialization

**Business Model Canvas**
- Customer Segments: Target customers、Value Propositions: Value delivered to customers、Channels: How to reach customers
- Customer Relationships: How to build/maintain relationships
- Revenue Streams: Revenue sources、Key Resources: Required management resources、Key Activities: Activities for value delivery
- Key Partners: Cooperative partners
- Cost Structure: Cost items、Purpose: Business model design and validation、Application: New business, existing business review

**Value Proposition Canvas**
- Customer Side: Customer jobs, pains, gains、Offering Side: Products/services, pain relievers, gain creators、Fit: Alignment of customer needs and value offered
- Purpose: Clarify customer value、Application: Product planning, marketing

**Go-to-Market Strategy**
- Market Segmentation: Clarify target market、Positioning: Differentiation from competition、Pricing Strategy: Price setting, revenue model
- Sales Channels: Direct sales, distributors, online
- Marketing Strategy: Awareness acquisition, lead generation、KPI Setting: CAC, LTV, churn rate、Application: Market entry plan

**Financial Planning**
- Revenue Forecast: Market size, share, growth rate、Cost Planning: Fixed costs, variable costs、P&L Plan: Income statement, break-even point
- Funding Plan: Required funds, procurement method、ROI Analysis: Return on investment、Application: Business plan, investment decision

### Organizational Innovation

**Ambidexterity**
- Exploitation: Optimization and efficiency of existing business、Exploration: Search and experimentation of new business、Organizational Structure: Separation and coordination of exploitation and exploration organizations
- Resource Allocation: 70% exploitation, 20% exploration, 10% experimentation
- Application: Innovation promotion in large companies

**Innovation Funnel**
- Stage 1 (Idea Creation): Collect large number of ideas、Stage 2 (Concept Development): Concretize ideas、Stage 3 (Feasibility Validation): Technology and market validation
- Stage 4 (Commercialization): Product development, market entry
- Gates: Criteria for passing each stage、Application: Innovation process management

**Open Innovation**
- Inbound: Incorporate external ideas and technologies、Outbound: External utilization of own technology、Coupled: Bi-directional collaboration
- Methods: Industry-academia collaboration, startup partnerships, contests, accelerators
- Application: Technology introduction, new business creation

**Innovation Culture Development**
- Psychological Safety: Allow failures, free expression、Experimentation Orientation: Try small, learn fast、Customer Orientation: Learn from customers, co-create
- Diversity: Different perspectives, backgrounds、Mechanisms: Innovation time, awards, budget
