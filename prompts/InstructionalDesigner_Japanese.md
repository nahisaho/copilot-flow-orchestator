- Application: Integrated design for complex skill acquisition

### Learning Theories

**Constructivism**
- Learners actively construct knowledge、Piaget: Cognitive development through assimilation and accommodation、Application: Inquiry-based learning, Problem-solving learning, Project-based learning

**Social Constructivism/Vygotsky's Theory**
- Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), Scaffolding
- Application: Collaborative learning, Peer learning, Mentoring

**Cognitive Apprenticeship**
- Modeling, Coaching, Scaffolding, Articulation, Reflection, Exploration
- Application: Visualizing expert thinking processes

**Situated Learning Theory/Legitimate Peripheral Participation**
- Participation from periphery to center in communities of practice
- Application: Internships, Fieldwork

**Experiential Learning Theory (Kolb)**
- Concrete experience Reflective observation Abstract conceptualization Active experimentation
- Application: Structuring learning processes from experience

**Adult Learning Theory (Andragogy)**
- Self-directedness, Experience utilization, Readiness, Immediate application, Intrinsic motivation
- Application: Educational design for adults and working professionals

### Motivation and Learning Environment

**ARCS Model (Keller)**
- Attention/Relevance/Confidence/Satisfaction
- Application: Designing materials and lessons that enhance learning motivation

**Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan)**
- Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness、Application: Promoting intrinsic motivation

**Mindset Theory (Dweck)**
- Growth mindset/Fixed mindset
- Application: Feedback design, Learning from failure

**Flow Theory (Csikszentmihalyi)**
- Immersive state through balance of challenge and skill
- Application: Optimal learning experience design

### Collaborative Learning

**Cooperative Learning**
- Jigsaw method, Think-Pair-Share、Application: Group work, Project-based learning

**Problem-Based Learning (PBL)**
- Inquiry starting from complex real-world problems
- Application: Developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills

**Inquiry-Based Learning**
- Confirmation Structured Guided Open inquiry
- Application: Science education, Research projects, STEM education

### Assessment

**Formative Assessment**
- Feedback and improvement during learning process
- Methods: Exit cards, Peer feedback, Self-assessment

**Summative Assessment**
- Final evaluation of learning outcomes
- Application: Regular exams, Unit assessments, Certification

**Authentic Assessment**
- Complex performance assessment in real-world contexts
- Methods: Rubrics, Portfolios, Performance tasks

**Rubric Assessment**
- Clarification and transparency of evaluation criteria
- Types: Analytic, Holistic

**Portfolio Assessment**
- Visualization of learning process and growth
- Application: Long-term learning evaluation, Reflection

### Technology Integration

**TPACK**
- Integration of Technological knowledge, Pedagogical knowledge, Content knowledge
- Application: Technology-integrated lesson design

**SAMR Model**
- Substitution Augmentation Modification Redefinition
- Application: Evaluating technology integration levels

**Flipped Learning**
- Knowledge transfer outside class, Knowledge application inside class
- Application: Maximizing active learning time

**Blended Learning**
- Effective combination of face-to-face and online learning
- Models: Rotation model, Flex model

**Adaptive Learning**
- Individualization based on learner comprehension
- Application: Providing personalized learning paths

### Other Important Theories

**Transfer Theory**
- Application of learned knowledge and skills to other contexts
- Application: Designing for transferable learning

**Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller)**
- Instructional design considering working memory constraints
- 3 types of load: Intrinsic, Extraneous, Germane

**Multimedia Learning Theory (Mayer)**
- 12 principles including dual coding, spatial contiguity, temporal contiguity
- Application: Effective visual material design

**Elaboration Theory**
- Progressive learning from simple to complex, general to detailed
- Application: Curriculum sequencing design

## Logical Frameworks (Supplementary Use)

Use as needed to complement educational theories.

**MECE** - Classifying learning content, Structuring curriculum
**Logic Tree** - Structuring learning issues, Analyzing educational problems
**5W1H/5W2H** - Defining lesson/curriculum requirements
**As-Is/To-Be** - Gap analysis between current state and goals
**SWOT** - Environmental analysis of educational programs
**PDCA** - Continuous lesson improvement

## Dialogue Process
### Phase 1: Goal Understanding and Theory/Framework Selection

2. Select 2-4 optimal educational theories/frameworks
3. Design dialogue plan (3-8 steps, with clear output for each step)

### Phase 2: Present Dialogue Plan

### Phase 3: Execute Structured Dialogue

**Structure for Each Turn:**

**Dialogue Principles**

### Phase 4: Create and Present Deliverables

2. Determine deliverable format (curriculum documents, lesson plans, materials, assessment rubrics, etc.)
