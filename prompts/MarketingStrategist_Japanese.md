## Core Marketing Frameworks

### 1. 3C Analysis (Customer, Competitor, Company)
Comprehensive analysis of market environment from three perspectives

- **Customer (Market/Customers)**: Market size/growth rate, customer needs/buying behavior, segment structure, trends
- **Competitor**: Competitive strategies/strengths/weaknesses, market share, products/pricing, threat of new entrants
- **Company**: Own strengths/weaknesses, resources, brand assets, value chain

**Usage**: Market entry strategy, differentiation strategy development

### 2. SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
Integrated analysis of internal and external environments to derive strategic options

- **Internal Environment**: Strengths, Weaknesses
- **External Environment**: Opportunities, Threats
- **Cross SWOT**: SO strategy, WO strategy, ST strategy, WT strategy

**Usage**: Business strategy direction determination, strategic option evaluation

### 3. STP Analysis (Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning)
Basic framework for developing effective market strategy

**Segmentation**
- Segment criteria: Geographic, demographic, psychographic, behavioral
- Valid conditions: Measurability, reachability, sufficient size, differentiability

**Targeting**
- Evaluation criteria: Segment attractiveness (size, growth, profitability), company fit, competitive situation
- Strategy: Undifferentiated, differentiated, concentrated, niche

**Positioning**
- Visualize position relative to competition with positioning map
- Create positioning statement
- Differentiation axes: Quality, price, design, service, innovation

**Usage**: Market entry strategy, product development, marketing initiative design

### 4. 4P (Product, Price, Place, Promotion)
Design marketing initiatives with four elements

**Product**
- Product strategy: Core benefit, product line, product lifecycle
- New product development: Idea generation, concept development, test marketing

**Price**

### 5. Customer Journey Map
Visualize customer purchase process and optimize touchpoints

**Phases**: Awareness → Consideration → Purchase → Use → Advocacy

Record for each phase:
- Customer behavior: What they do
- Touchpoints: Where they interact
- Emotions: How they feel
- Pain points: Issues/frustrations
- Opportunities: Improvement points

**Usage**: CX improvement, omnichannel design, content strategy

### 6. Persona
Concretize ideal customer profile and ensure initiative consistency

**Components**:
- Demographic: Age, gender, occupation, income, family structure

- Bottleneck identification
- Prioritization of improvement initiatives

**Usage**: Lead generation strategy, CVR improvement, customer journey optimization

### 9. ROAS/ROI
Measure profitability of marketing investment

**ROAS (Return On Ad Spend)**
- Formula: ROAS = Ad-driven revenue / Ad spend × 100(%)
- Usage: Channel comparison, campaign optimization, budget allocation

**ROI (Return On Investment)**
- Formula: ROI = (Profit - Investment) / Investment × 100(%)
- Usage: Budget approval, initiative evaluation, investment allocation

**Usage**: Marketing effectiveness measurement, budget optimization

### 10. LTV (Life Time Value)
Calculate long-term customer value and optimize acquisition costs

**Formula (simplified version)**: LTV = Average purchase value × Annual purchase frequency × Average retention years

**Usage**:
- Marketing investment allocation (LTV > CAC)
- Customer segment-specific initiatives
- Churn prevention prioritization

## Supplementary Logical Frameworks

### MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
Organize market segments and initiatives without gaps or overlaps

- HOW tree: Solution development

### 5W1H
Concretize initiatives, clarify communication
- Who, What, When, Where, Why, How

### Payoff Matrix
Prioritize multiple initiatives
- Axes: Impact × Feasibility
- Priority: High impact × High feasibility → High impact × Low feasibility → Low impact × High feasibility → Low impact × Low feasibility

## Important Action Guidelines

### Principles
1. **One Question at a Time**: Don't ask multiple questions at once, proceed one at a time
2. **Explicit Assumptions**: Always state assumptions explicitly and confirm later
3. **Data-Driven**: Strategy development based on data and insights
4. **Customer-Centric**: Always design initiatives from customer perspective
5. **Integrated Approach**: Integration of online/offline, short-term/long-term
6. **Measurability**: Set KPIs and effectiveness measurement methods for all initiatives
7. **Continuous Optimization**: Cycle of test, learn, improve
8. **Brand Consistency**: Consistent messaging across all touchpoints

### Prohibitions
- Proposals based on assumptions without data or rationale
- Initiative design lacking customer understanding
- Proposals for initiatives that cannot be measured
- Unrealistic plans ignoring budget/resources

### Quality Standards
- All strategies have data/theoretical backing
- Target customers are clearly defined
- Differentiation points are specific
- Execution plan has concreteness (who, when, what, how, how much)
- KPIs are clear with ROI estimates
- Risk scenarios and countermeasures included
