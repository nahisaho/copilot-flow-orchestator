## Major Policy Design Frameworks
### Policy Process & Cycle Systems

**Policy Cycle**
- Phases:
 1. **Agenda Setting**: Problem recognition and prioritization
 2. **Policy Formulation**: Option development, analysis
 3. **Policy Adoption**: Decision-making, consensus building
 4. **Policy Implementation**: Execution, operation
 5. **Policy Evaluation**: Effect measurement, improvement
 6. **Policy Termination/Change**: Abolition, revision
- Features: Cyclical, iterative, learning process

**Kingdon's Multiple Streams Model (Policy Window Model)**
- Three streams:
 1. **Problem Stream**: Recognition of social problems
 2. **Policy Stream**: Policy ideas and solutions
 3. **Political Stream**: Political environment, public opinion
- **Policy Window**: When three streams converge, opportunity for policy change opens
- Utilization: Timing strategy, agenda setting

**Punctuated Equilibrium Theory**
- Policy alternates between long periods of stability and rapid change
- Changes in policy image and venue trigger major transformations

**Policy Transfer & Policy Learning**
- Learn from and adapt policies of other countries/regions、Types: Copy, emulation, mixing, inspiration

### Policy Analysis & Evaluation Systems

**Logic Model**
- Structure:、**Input**: Resources (budget, personnel, time)、**Activity**: Programs and activities to implement
 - **Output**: Direct results of activities (number of services provided, etc.)
 - **Impact**: Ultimate social impact
- **Theory of Change**: Causal hypothesis of why activities produce results

**Types of Policy Evaluation**
- **Ex-Ante Evaluation**:
- **Formative Evaluation**:
- Improvement during implementation, process evaluation、**Summative Evaluation**:、Ex-post evaluation, outcome evaluation, impact evaluation、**Meta-Evaluation**:、Evaluation of evaluation

**Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**
- Procedure:
 1. Identify and monetize benefits
 2. Identify and monetize costs
 3. Calculate present value using discount rate
 4. Calculate Net Present Value (NPV), Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)
- Decision criteria: NPV > 0, BCR > 1、Challenge: Difficulty monetizing intangible benefits

**Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)**
- Divide cost by effectiveness (non-monetary unit)、Examples: Cost per QALY, Cost per ton CO2 reduced、Utilization: Comparing multiple policies with same goal

**Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA)**
- Process:
 1. Define problem
 2. Set policy objectives
 3. Identify alternatives
 4. Impact analysis (benefits, costs, risks)
 5. Consultation/public comment
 6. Select recommended option
 7. Post-implementation monitoring plan
- Purpose: Improving regulatory quality, transparency, accountability

**Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)**
- Gold standard causal inference method、Random assignment of intervention and control groups、Highest quality of evidence
- Utilization: Pilot projects, policy effect verification

**Quasi-Experimental Methods**
- Alternative methods when RCT is difficult:、Difference-in-Differences (DID)、Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)、Propensity Score Matching (PSM)、Instrumental Variables (IV)

### Stakeholder Analysis & Consensus Building Systems

**Stakeholder Analysis**
- Steps:
 1. **Identification**: List all stakeholders
 2. **Classification**: Map by influence and interest intensity
 3. **Understanding**: Interests, concerns, expectations of each stakeholder
 4. **Strategy**: Develop engagement strategy
- Matrix:
 - Vertical axis: Influence (high/low)
 - Horizontal axis: Interest intensity (high/low)
- Strategy:、High influence × High interest: Focused engagement、High influence × Low interest: Maintain satisfaction、Low influence × High interest: Information provision、Low influence × Low interest: Monitoring

**Power-Interest Matrix**
- Evaluate each stakeholder's power (resources, authority) and interests
- Coalition formation: Collaboration of stakeholders with aligned interests

**Participatory Policy Design**
- Methods:
 - **Citizens' Panels**: Deliberation by randomly selected citizens
- **Town Hall Meetings**: Public discussions、**Design Workshops**: Co-creative design、**Online Consultation**: Digital platform utilization
- Benefits: Enhanced legitimacy, diverse perspectives, increased acceptance

**Consensus Building Approaches**
- **Interest-Based Negotiation**:、Focus on fundamental interests, not positions、Explore Win-Win solutions、**Mediation**: Coordination by neutral third party
- **Incremental consensus building**: Accumulate small agreements

### Policy Option Development & Decision-Making Systems

**Policy Option Generation Methods**
- **Brainstorming**: Generate ideas through free thinking、**Benchmarking**: Learn from success stories of other countries/regions、**Scenario Planning**: Assume multiple future scenarios
- **Design Thinking**: User-centered creative problem solving

**Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA)**
- Compare policy options against multiple evaluation criteria
- Procedure:
 2. Weight criteria
 3. Score each option
 4. Calculate overall score
- Utilization: Complex decision-making, integrating non-monetized benefits

**Decision Matrix**
- Vertical axis: Policy options、Horizontal axis: Evaluation criteria、Cells: Scores or qualitative evaluation
- Weighting and overall evaluation

**SWOT Analysis (Policy Version)**
- **Strengths**: Policy strengths、**Weaknesses**: Policy weaknesses、**Opportunities**: External environment opportunities
- **Threats**: External environment threats、Utilization: Strategic policy formulation

**Policy Design Principles**
- **SMART Goals**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound、**3Es**: Effectiveness, Efficiency, Equity、**Targeting**: Clear identification of intervention targets
- **Phased Implementation**: Pilot Scale-up
- **Adaptive Management**: Built-in learning and adjustment processes

### Behavioral Economics & Nudge Systems

**Nudge**
- Definition: Mechanisms that guide toward better choices without coercion
- NUDGES Framework:、**iNcentives**: Incentives
- **Defaults**: Default settings、**Give feedback**: Feedback、**Expect error**: Design anticipating errors
 - **Structure complex choices**: Structuring complex choices

**EAST Framework (Behavioural Insights Team)**
- **Easy**: Make it easy、**Attractive**: Make it attractive、**Social**: Utilize social norms
- **Timely**: Optimize timing

**Barriers and Facilitators of Behavior Change**
