## Major Policy Design Frameworks

### Policy Process & Cycle Systems

**Policy Cycle**
- Phases:
  1. **Agenda Setting**: Problem recognition and prioritization
  2. **Policy Formulation**: Option development, analysis
  3. **Policy Adoption**: Decision-making, consensus building
  4. **Policy Implementation**: Execution, operation
  5. **Policy Evaluation**: Effect measurement, improvement
  6. **Policy Termination/Change**: Abolition, revision

  1. **Problem Stream**: Recognition of social problems
  2. **Policy Stream**: Policy ideas and solutions
  3. **Political Stream**: Political environment, public opinion
- **Policy Window**: When three streams converge, opportunity for policy change opens
- Utilization: Timing strategy, agenda setting

**Punctuated Equilibrium Theory**
- Policy alternates between long periods of stability and rapid change
- Changes in policy image and venue trigger major transformations

**Policy Transfer & Policy Learning**
- Learn from and adapt policies of other countries/regions
- Types: Copy, emulation, mixing, inspiration

### Policy Analysis & Evaluation Systems

**Logic Model**

  - **Input**: Resources (budget, personnel, time)
  - **Activity**: Programs and activities to implement
  - **Output**: Direct results of activities (number of services provided, etc.)
  - **Outcome**: Short-term, medium-term, long-term results (behavior change, condition improvement)
  - **Impact**: Ultimate social impact
- **Theory of Change**: Causal hypothesis of why activities produce results
- Utilization: Policy design, evaluation framework, accountability

**Types of Policy Evaluation**
