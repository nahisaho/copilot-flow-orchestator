## Presentation Design Framework System

### Storytelling Methods

**Pyramid Structure (Pyramid Principle)**
- Purpose: Logical message structure, top-down communication
- Elements: Conclusion first, MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive), hierarchical evidence
- Application: Business presentations, proposals, reports
- Structure: Main message → Key messages (3-5) → Supporting data

**Hero's Journey**
- Purpose: Emotional empathy, transformation stories
- Elements: Ordinary world → Challenge → Trials → Transformation → Return
- Application: Product launches, vision presentation, transformation presentations
- Effect: Audience emotional engagement, memory retention

**Problem-Solution Framework**
- Purpose: Problem presentation and solution presentation
- Structure: Current problem → Problem severity → Solution → Effects
- Application: Sales proposals, business proposals, improvement proposals
- Point: Gain empathy for problem before presenting solution

**Chronological Structure**
- Purpose: Process explanation, progress reports
- Structure: Past → Present → Future
- Application: Project reports, roadmaps, history explanations
- Effect: Understand flow, clarify cause-effect relationships

**Compare-Contrast Framework**
- Purpose: Option evaluation, differentiation
- Structure: Option A vs Option B → Evaluation axes → Recommendation
- Application: Decision support, competitive comparison, product comparison
- Point: Fair evaluation axes, clear recommendation rationale

### Message Design

**SUCCESs Framework**
- Simple: Core message in one phrase
- Unexpected: Surprising attention grabber
- Concrete: Imaginable expressions
- Credible: Supporting data, authority
- Emotional: Empathy, emotion
- Stories: Narrative format
- Purpose: Design memorable messages

**Rule of Three**
- Purpose: Memorable structure
- Principle: Narrow key points to three
- Rationale: Optimize cognitive load, rhythm, memory retention
- Application: Key messages, agendas, options

**Elevator Pitch Structure**
- Elements: To whom (target), what (value provided), how (differentiation)
- Time: Complete in 30-60 seconds
- Purpose: Presentation opening, summary slide
- Points: Concise, clear, attractive

### Slide Design Principles

**Visual Hierarchy Design**
- Principle: Express importance through size, color, placement
- Elements: Title (largest), key points (medium), details (small)
- Rule: One message per slide
- Application: Font sizes, contrast, white space

**Data Visualization Selection**
- Comparison: Bar charts (between categories)
- Trends: Line charts (time series)
- Composition: Pie charts (whole proportions)
- Correlation: Scatter plots (relationship between 2 variables)
- Distribution: Histograms (data distribution)
- Flow: Sankey diagrams (flows)
- Points: Appropriate chart selection, label axes

**Color Strategy**
- Base colors: Brand colors, 1-2 colors
- Accent colors: Actions, key points
- Background colors: White/black (ensure contrast)
- Principle: Consider color vision diversity, high contrast
- Application: Brand consistency, visibility

**White Space Utilization**
- Purpose: Visual breathing, information organization
- Principle: Don't overcrowd, focus
- Effect: Sophisticated impression, promote understanding
- Practice: 30-40% of slide as white space

### Presentation Structure

**Opening-Body-Closing Structure**
- Opening (10%): Hook, agenda, expectation setting
- Body (80%): Main content, logical development
- Closing (10%): Summary, CTA, Q&A
- Points: Strong opening, clear CTA

**Hook Techniques**
- Surprising Statistics: "90% of companies..."
- Questions: "What if...?"
- Stories: Short episodes
- Quotes: Famous person quotes
- Purpose: Grab attention in first 30 seconds

**Call to Action (CTA) Design**
- Elements: Specific action, deadline, method
- Principle: 1 CTA per presentation (clear next step)
- Expression: Start with verbs ("Register now", "Decide by tomorrow")
- Placement: Final slide, summary slide

### Audience Analysis

**Audience Segmentation**
- Decision Makers: Emphasize conclusions, ROI, risks
- Practitioners: Emphasize specifics, feasibility, procedures
- Experts: Emphasize technical details, evidence, accuracy
- General: Emphasize simplicity, visuals, stories
- Response: Adjust slide detail, prepare supplementary materials

**WIIFM Analysis (What's In It For Me)**
- Purpose: Clarify benefits from audience perspective
- Question: What does audience gain from this presentation?
- Application: Be aware of audience value in each slide
- Effect: Maintain interest, promote action
