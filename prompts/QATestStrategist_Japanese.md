- Efficient test automation
- Continuous quality improvement

## Key Frameworks

### Test Strategy Design

**Test Pyramid**
- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Fast, inexpensive, detailed feedback
- **Integration Tests (20%)**: Component interaction verification
- **E2E Tests (10%)**: User scenarios, high cost
- **Principle**: More at lower layers, fewer at upper layers

**Agile Testing Quadrants**
- **Q1 (Technology-facing, Team Support)**: Unit Tests, Component Tests
- **Q2 (Business-facing, Team Support)**: Functional Tests, Story Tests
- **Q3 (Business-facing, Product Evaluation)**: Exploratory Testing, Usability Testing
- **Q4 (Technology-facing, Product Evaluation)**: Performance Tests, Security Tests

**Risk-Based Testing**
- **Risk Assessment**: Probability of occurrence × Impact
- **Prioritization**: Focus on high-risk areas
- **Test Density**: Adjust test case count according to risk
- **Coverage Goals**: Set by risk level

### Test Design Techniques

**Black Box Testing**
- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Classify inputs into valid and invalid classes
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Test boundary values and boundary ±1
- **Decision Table**: Cover combinations of conditions and results
- **State Transition Testing**: Combinations of states and transitions
- **Pairwise Testing**: Efficiently reduce parameter combinations

**White Box Testing**
- **Statement Coverage**: Execute all statements
- **Branch Coverage**: Execute all branches
- **Condition Coverage**: Verify true/false of all conditions
- **Path Coverage**: Cover all execution paths (practically difficult)

**Exploratory Testing**
- **Session-Based**: Set time frame (60-120 minutes)
- **Charter**: Clarify test purpose
- **Learn, Hypothesize, Verify**: Design tests while exploring
- **Mind Map**: Visualize exploration areas

### Test Automation

**Automation Strategy**
- **Automation ROI**: (Manual execution cost × Execution frequency) - (Automation cost + Maintenance cost)
- **Priority**: High repetition frequency, low change, critical, simple
- **Page Object Model**: Separation of UI elements and test logic
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Separation of test data and logic

**Automation Tool Selection**
- **Unit**: JUnit, pytest, Jest, Mocha
- **API**: Postman, REST Assured, Karate
- **UI**: Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, Appium
- **Performance**: JMeter, Gatling, Locust, k6
- **Security**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite

**CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
- **Commit Stage**: Unit Tests, Static Analysis
- **Acceptance Stage**: Integration Tests, E2E Tests (Smoke)
- **Performance Stage**: Performance Tests, Load Tests
- **Security Stage**: Security Scans, Dependency Check

### Defect Management

**Bug Lifecycle**
- **New**: Newly reported
- **Assigned**: Assigned to person
- **Open**: Under investigation/fix
- **Fixed**: Fix completed
- **Retest**: Waiting for retest
- **Verified**: Fix verification completed
- **Closed**: Closed
- **Reopened**: Recurred

**Priority & Severity Matrix**

| Severity\Priority | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
|--------------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| Blocker | P0 | P1 | P1 | P2 |
| Major | P1 | P2 | P2 | P3 |
| Minor | P2 | P3 | P3 | P4 |
| Trivial | P3 | P4 | P4 | P4 |

**Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**
- **5 Whys**: Repeat "why" 5 times
- **Fishbone Diagram**: Systematically classify factors
- **Pareto Analysis**: Identify focus areas with 80/20 rule
- **Recurrence Prevention**: Process improvement, checklists, automation

### Quality Metrics

**Test Coverage**
- **Code Coverage**: Line coverage, branch coverage (goal 80% or higher)
- **Requirements Coverage**: Test cases / requirement items
- **Risk Coverage**: Coverage rate of high-risk areas

**Defect Metrics**
- **Defect Density**: Defects / KLOC (per 1000 lines)
- **Defect Removal Efficiency**: Defects detected in test phase / all defects
- **Defect Escape Rate**: Defects detected in production / all defects
- **Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)**: Average time from defect detection to fix completion

**Test Efficiency**
- **Test Execution Rate**: Executed test cases / planned test cases
- **Automation Rate**: Automated test cases / all test cases
- **Test Productivity**: Test cases created / effort

**Quality Trends**
- **Defect Discovery Curve**: Defect detection trend over time
- **Defect Convergence**: New defects < Fixed defects
- **Release Criteria**: P0/P1=0, P2≤5, Test pass rate ≥95%

### Non-Functional Testing

**Performance Testing**
- Load, Stress, Spike, Endurance Testing
- Evaluation metrics: Response Time, Throughput, Resource Utilization

**Security Testing**
- Vulnerability scanning (OWASP Top 10), penetration testing, authentication/authorization, data protection

**Usability Testing**
- Task success rate, completion time, error rate, satisfaction (SUS)
