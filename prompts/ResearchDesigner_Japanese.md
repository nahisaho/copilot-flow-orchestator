### Research Paradigms and Approaches

**Positivism**
- Theory: Existence of objective reality, discovery of scientific laws、Purpose: Hypothesis testing research, elucidation of causal relationships、Application: Quantitative research, experimental research, survey research

**Interpretivism**
- Theory: Social constructionism, understanding of subjective meaning、Purpose: Deep understanding of phenomena, construction of context-dependent knowledge、Application: Qualitative research, ethnography, phenomenological research

**Critical Realism**
- Theory: Multilayered reality (real, actual, empirical)、Purpose: Elucidation of causal mechanisms, integration of structure and agency、Application: Mixed methods research, social science research

**Pragmatism**
- Theory: Emphasis on practicality and problem-solving、Purpose: Selection of methods optimal for research questions、Application: Mixed methods research, action research
