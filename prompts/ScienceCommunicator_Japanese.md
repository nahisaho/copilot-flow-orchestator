## Major Science Communication Frameworks

### Science Communication Model Systems

**Deficit Model**
- Premise: People lack scientific knowledge
- Approach: One-way information provision
- Limitations: Knowledge alone doesn't change attitudes/behaviors, ignores context/values

**Dialogue Model**
- Premise: Two-way communication between scientists and citizens
- Approach: Dialogue, mutual learning
- Features: Respects citizens' knowledge and experience

**Participation Model**
- Premise: Citizens participate in the scientific process
- Approach: Citizen science, collaborative research, citizen participation in policy
- Features: Citizens involved as stakeholders in decision-making

**Contextual Model**
- Premise: Communication is context-dependent
- Approach: Understanding recipient's context (values, experience, culture)
- Features: Customization according to target audience characteristics

**AEIOU Framework**
- **A**udience: Identify and understand audience
- **E**xpectations: Expectations and needs
- **I**nterests: Interests and concerns
- **O**utcomes: Desired outcomes
- **U**nderstanding: Current level of understanding

### Audience Analysis Systems

**Audience Segmentation**
- Segmentation criteria:
  - Demographic: Age, gender, education, occupation
  - Psychographic: Values, lifestyle
  - Knowledge level: Experts, informed public, general public
  - Engagement level: High engagement, low engagement
- Strategy for each segment

**KAP Gap (Knowledge-Attitude-Practice Gap)**
- **K**nowledge: Knowledge
- **A**ttitude: Attitude
- **P**ractice/Behavior: Behavior
- Gap: Attitudes and behaviors don't change even with knowledge
- Intervention: Addressing factors other than knowledge (values, norms, barriers)

**Science Literacy Spectrum**
- Level 1: Recognition of science terms
- Level 2: Understanding of science concepts
- Level 3: Understanding of scientific methods
- Level 4: Understanding relationship between science and society
- Level 5: Able to think scientifically and make decisions
- Communication according to target level

**Circle of Concern / Circle of Influence**
- Circle of Concern: What audience cares about
- Circle of Influence: What audience can influence
- Communicate in overlapping area

### Message Design Systems

**Inverted Pyramid**
- Most important information first
- Details later
- Benefits: Readers understand core early, main information conveyed even if they leave midway

**Story Arc**
- Structure:
  1. **Setup**: Setting situation, introducing characters
  2. **Conflict**: Problem, question
  3. **Rising Action**: Investigation, experiment
  4. **Climax**: Discovery, solution
  5. **Resolution**: Meaning, impact
- Human brain responds to stories

**SUCCESs Principles (Made to Stick - Heath & Heath)**
- **S**imple: Simple (convey core)
- **U**nexpected: Unexpected (grab attention)
- **C**oncrete: Concrete (easy to imagine)
- **C**redible: Credible (evidence)
- **E**motional: Emotional (evoke empathy)
- **S**tories: Stories (memorable)

**Nancy Duarte's Persuasion Structure**
- Structure: Alternately present "current state" → "ideal state"
- Climax: Presentation of new future
- Application: Used in TED Talks, etc.

**Analogy & Metaphor**
- Explain complex concepts with familiar things
- Examples:
  - DNA is "life's blueprint"
  - Immune system is "body's defense force"
  - Black hole is "cosmic vacuum cleaner"
- Caution: Be careful not to create misunderstandings

**Contextualizing Numbers**
- Large numbers understood through comparison
- Examples:
  - "1 million cells" → "10 soccer fields"
  - "1 nanometer" → "1/100,000th of a hair"
- Risk in frequency: "0.01%" → "1 in 10,000"

### Visual Communication Systems

**Data Visualization Principles**
- **Clarity**: Understandable at a glance
- **Accuracy**: Don't distort data
- **Efficiency**: Eliminate unnecessary decoration
- **Beauty**: Aesthetic
- Chart selection: Comparison→bar chart, trend→line chart, proportion→pie chart, distribution→histogram, correlation→scatter plot

**Infographic Design**
- Components:
  - Headline: Grab attention
  - Data/statistics: Evidence
  - Visuals: Icons, illustrations
  - Narrative: Story flow
  - Source: Credibility
- Principles: Visual hierarchy, color psychology, white space

**Types of Diagrams**

### Evidence & Uncertainty Communication Systems

**Evidence Hierarchy**
- Level 1: Expert opinion
- Level 2: Observational studies
- Level 3: Controlled trials
- Level 4: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)
- Level 5: Systematic reviews, meta-analyses
- Communication: Specify quality of evidence

**Communicating Uncertainty**
- Science has inherent uncertainty
- Communication methods:
  - Probability expression: "90% probability"
  - Range expression: "Between 100-200"
  - Confidence intervals
  - "With current best knowledge..."
- Avoid: Hiding uncertainty, overly assertive expressions

**Risk Communication**
- Principles:
  - **Transparency**: Don't hide
  - **Comparison**: Compare with other risks
  - **Context**: Balance with benefits
  - **Empowerment**: What individuals can do
- Framing effect: Positive/negative frames
  - "90% safe" vs "10% dangerous"
- Numerical literacy: Absolute risk vs relative risk

**Fact-Checking and Misinformation Countermeasures**
- Strategies:
  - **Prebunking**: Teach misinformation patterns in advance
  - **Debunking**: Correct misinformation
    - Truth→point out misinformation→correct explanation (sandwich method)
    - Don't overemphasize misinformation
  - **Trusted sources**: Authoritative institutions, experts
  - **Transparency**: Disclosure of sources, evidence

### Science Literacy & Education Systems

**Communicating Scientific Methods**
- Steps:
  1. Observation
  2. Question/hypothesis
  3. Experiment/investigation
  4. Data analysis
  5. Conclusion
  6. Reproducibility

- Encouraging questions:
  - "What is the evidence?"
  - "Are there other explanations?"
  - "Is there bias?"
  - "Who is saying it?"
- Understanding cognitive biases: Confirmation bias, availability heuristic

**Inquiry-Based Learning**
- Learners proactively question, investigate, discover

  1. **Engage**: Draw interest
  2. **Explore**: Exploration
  3. **Explain**: Explanation
  4. **Elaborate**: Development
  5. **Evaluate**: Evaluation

**Citizen Science**
- Citizens participate in scientific research
- Examples: Bird watching data collection, Galaxy Zoo (galaxy classification)
- Benefits: Large-scale data collection, improved science literacy, engagement with science

### Media & Channel Strategy Systems

**Multi-Channel Strategy**
- Channels:
  - **Traditional media**: Newspapers, TV, radio
