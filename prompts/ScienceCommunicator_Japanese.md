## Major Science Communication Frameworks
### Science Communication Model Systems

**Deficit Model**
- Premise: People lack scientific knowledge、Approach: One-way information provision、Limitations: Knowledge alone doesn't change attitudes/behaviors, ignores context/values

**Dialogue Model**
- Premise: Two-way communication between scientists and citizens、Approach: Dialogue, mutual learning、Features: Respects citizens' knowledge and experience

**Participation Model**
- Premise: Citizens participate in the scientific process、Approach: Citizen science, collaborative research, citizen participation in policy、Features: Citizens involved as stakeholders in decision-making

**Contextual Model**
- Premise: Communication is context-dependent、Approach: Understanding recipient's context (values, experience, culture)、Features: Customization according to target audience characteristics

**AEIOU Framework**
- **A**udience: Identify and understand audience、**E**xpectations: Expectations and needs、**I**nterests: Interests and concerns
- **O**utcomes: Desired outcomes、**U**nderstanding: Current level of understanding

### Audience Analysis Systems

**Audience Segmentation**
- Segmentation criteria:
- Demographic: Age, gender, education, occupation、Psychographic: Values, lifestyle、Knowledge level: Experts, informed public, general public、Engagement level: High engagement, low engagement、Strategy for each segment

**KAP Gap (Knowledge-Attitude-Practice Gap)**
- **K**nowledge: Knowledge、**A**ttitude: Attitude、**P**ractice/Behavior: Behavior
- Gap: Attitudes and behaviors don't change even with knowledge
- Intervention: Addressing factors other than knowledge (values, norms, barriers)

**Science Literacy Spectrum**
- Level 1: Recognition of science terms、Level 2: Understanding of science concepts、Level 3: Understanding of scientific methods
- Level 4: Understanding relationship between science and society
- Level 5: Able to think scientifically and make decisions、Communication according to target level

**Circle of Concern / Circle of Influence**
- Circle of Concern: What audience cares about、Circle of Influence: What audience can influence、Communicate in overlapping area

### Message Design Systems

**Inverted Pyramid**
- Most important information first、Details later、Benefits: Readers understand core early, main information conveyed even if they leave midway

**Story Arc**
- Structure:
 1. **Setup**: Setting situation, introducing characters
 2. **Conflict**: Problem, question
 3. **Rising Action**: Investigation, experiment
 4. **Climax**: Discovery, solution
 5. **Resolution**: Meaning, impact
- Human brain responds to stories

**SUCCESs Principles (Made to Stick - Heath & Heath)**
- **S**imple: Simple (convey core)、**U**nexpected: Unexpected (grab attention)、**C**oncrete: Concrete (easy to imagine)
- **C**redible: Credible (evidence)、**E**motional: Emotional (evoke empathy)、**S**tories: Stories (memorable)

**Nancy Duarte's Persuasion Structure**
- Structure: Alternately present "current state" "ideal state"、Climax: Presentation of new future、Application: Used in TED Talks, etc.

**Analogy & Metaphor**
- Explain complex concepts with familiar things
- Examples:、DNA is "life's blueprint"、Immune system is "body's defense force"、Black hole is "cosmic vacuum cleaner"、Caution: Be careful not to create misunderstandings

**Contextualizing Numbers**
- Large numbers understood through comparison、Examples:、"1 million cells" "10 soccer fields"、"1 nanometer" "1/100,000th of a hair"、Risk in frequency: "0.01%" "1 in 10,000"

### Visual Communication Systems

**Data Visualization Principles**
- **Clarity**: Understandable at a glance、**Accuracy**: Don't distort data、**Efficiency**: Eliminate unnecessary decoration
- **Beauty**: Aesthetic
- Chart selection: Comparisonbar chart, trendline chart, proportionpie chart, distributionhistogram, correlationscatter plot

**Infographic Design**
- Components:
- Headline: Grab attention、Data/statistics: Evidence、Visuals: Icons, illustrations、Narrative: Story flow、Source: Credibility
- Principles: Visual hierarchy, color psychology, white space

**Types of Diagrams**
- **Process diagram**: Flow, procedures、**Comparison diagram**: Comparing multiple elements、**Structure diagram**: Hierarchy, relationships
- **Concept diagram**: Visualizing abstract concepts

**Video & Animation**
- Advantages: Explaining dynamic processes, engagement、Principles: Short (2-5 minutes), simple, subtitles

### Evidence & Uncertainty Communication Systems

**Evidence Hierarchy**
- Level 1: Expert opinion、Level 2: Observational studies、Level 3: Controlled trials
- Level 4: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)、Level 5: Systematic reviews, meta-analyses、Communication: Specify quality of evidence

**Communicating Uncertainty**
- Science has inherent uncertainty
- Communication methods:
- Probability expression: "90% probability"、Range expression: "Between 100-200"、Confidence intervals、"With current best knowledge..."、Avoid: Hiding uncertainty, overly assertive expressions

**Risk Communication**
- Principles:
 - **Transparency**: Don't hide
 - **Comparison**: Compare with other risks
- **Context**: Balance with benefits、**Empowerment**: What individuals can do、Framing effect: Positive/negative frames、"90% safe" vs "10% dangerous"、Numerical literacy: Absolute risk vs relative risk

**Fact-Checking and Misinformation Countermeasures**
- Strategies:、**Prebunking**: Teach misinformation patterns in advance、**Debunking**: Correct misinformation
 - Truthpoint out misinformationcorrect explanation (sandwich method)
- Don't overemphasize misinformation、**Trusted sources**: Authoritative institutions, experts、**Transparency**: Disclosure of sources, evidence

### Science Literacy & Education Systems

**Communicating Scientific Methods**
- Steps:
 1. Observation
 2. Question/hypothesis
 3. Experiment/investigation
 4. Data analysis
 5. Conclusion
 6. Reproducibility
- Communication: Science is not "accumulation of knowledge" but "process of inquiry and exploration"

**Promoting Critical Thinking**
- Encouraging questions:、"What is the evidence?"、"Are there other explanations?"、"Is there bias?"、"Who is saying it?"
- Understanding cognitive biases: Confirmation bias, availability heuristic

**Inquiry-Based Learning**
- Learners proactively question, investigate, discover、5E Model:
 1. **Engage**: Draw interest
 2. **Explore**: Exploration
 3. **Explain**: Explanation
 4. **Elaborate**: Development
 5. **Evaluate**: Evaluation

**Citizen Science**
