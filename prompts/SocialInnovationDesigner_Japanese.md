## Major Social Innovation Frameworks
### Social Issue Analysis & Systems Thinking Systems

**Systems Thinking**
- Principles: Interdependence, feedback loops, delays, non-linearity、Tools: Causal loop diagrams, stock-flow diagrams, system archetypes、Intervention points: Identifying leverage points, changing system structure

**Iceberg Model**
- Four levels:
 1. **Events**: Visible phenomena
 2. **Patterns**: Recurring trends
 3. **Structures**: Mechanisms that generate patterns
 4. **Mental Models**: Assumptions and values
- Utilization: Approaching root causes, not superficial symptoms

**Root Cause Analysis**
- Methods: Five Whys, Fishbone diagram, Logic tree、Purpose: Fundamental solutions, not symptomatic treatment

**Social Issue Mapping**
- Elements: Actors, relationships, impact pathways, intervention points
- Tools: Stakeholder maps, ecosystem maps

### Theory of Change Systems

**Theory of Change (ToC)**
- Definition: Explicit statement of desired long-term change and causal pathways to achieve it
- Components:
 1. **Long-term goal**: Ultimate change to realize
 2. **Preconditions**: Necessary conditions for achieving goal
 3. **Interventions**: Activities to implement
 4. **Outputs**: Direct results of activities
 5. **Outcomes**: Short-term, medium-term, long-term changes
 6. **Assumptions/hypotheses**: Assumptions about causal relationships
 7. **External factors**: External environment affecting outcomes
- Process: Long-term goal setting (backcasting), identifying preconditions, building causal pathways, intervention design, indicator setting, stating assumptions
- Utilization: Strategy design, communication, evaluation framework

**Logic Model**
- Input Activity Output Outcome Impact
- Difference from ToC: Simpler and more linear, implementation-oriented

**Impact Pathway**
- Describes pathway from activities to final impact in stages

### Social Business & Business Model Systems

**Social Business Model Canvas**
- Nine elements: Customer segments, value proposition, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, cost structure、Additional elements: Social impact, beneficiaries、Features: Complexity when beneficiaries and customers differ

**Lean Canvas**
- For startups, explicitly states hypotheses to verify
- Elements: Problem, customer segments, unique value proposition, solution, channels, revenue streams, cost structure, key metrics, unfair advantage

**Hybrid Value Creation**
- Simultaneous creation of social value and economic value、Types: Integrated, mutually reinforcing, separated

**Monetization Models**
- Direct revenue, subsidies/grants, donations, cross-subsidy, fee-for-service, membership, licensing

**Scaling Strategies**
- Direct scaling, replication, open sourcing, policy change, partnerships, franchising

### Social Impact Evaluation Systems

**Social Impact Evaluation Hierarchy**
- **Input**: Resources invested、**Activity**: Activities implemented、**Output**: Direct results of activities
- **Outcome**: Changes in beneficiaries and society、**Impact**: Long-term, widespread social change

**SROI (Social Return on Investment)**
- Social return on investment、Formula: SROI = Present value of social value / Input cost、Process: Define scope and identify stakeholders, outcome mapping, evidence collection and valuation, establish impact, calculate SROI, report/use/verify
- Monetization methods: Market prices, revealed preference, stated preference, wellbeing valuation

**Impact Management Project (IMP) Five Dimensions**
1. What：What outcomes
2. **Who**: Whose outcomes
3. How Much：Scale, depth, duration
4. **Contribution**: How much contributed
5. Risk：Risk of achieving goals

**Impact Management Cycle**
1. Plan：ToC, goal setting, indicator design
2. **Execute**: Implement activities
3. Evaluate：Data collection, analysis, evaluation
4. **Report**: Reporting to stakeholders
5. Improve：Learning and strategy adjustment

**Outcome Metrics Design**
- **SMART Indicators**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound、Types: Quantitative indicators, qualitative indicators、Collection methods: Surveys, interviews, observation, existing data, RCT

**Attribution**
- Calculate net impact considering deadweight, attribution, drop-off

### Collective Impact & Collaboration Systems

**Collective Impact**
- Definition: Organizations from multiple sectors collaborate on common agenda to realize system-level transformation
- Five conditions:
 1. **Common Agenda**: Shared vision and goals
 2. **Shared Measurement System**: Measure progress with unified indicators
 3. **Mutually Reinforcing Activities**: Synergy among organizational activities
 4. **Continuous Communication**: Trust building and coordination
 5. **Backbone Organization**: Overall coordinator
- Process: Shared understanding of problem, co-creation of vision and strategy, role division, execution and learning, adaptation

**Ecosystem Building**
- Actor mapping, network formation, resource circulation, infrastructure development

**Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships**
- Stakeholders: Government/municipalities, companies/industry, NPOs/NGOs, citizens/communities, academic institutions, financial institutions/investors
- Partnership forms: Councils, consortiums, platforms

**Principles of Collaboration**
- Complementarity, equality, transparency, continuity

### CSV & Sustainability Management Systems

**CSV (Creating Shared Value)**
- Definition: Simultaneously create economic value and social value
- Three approaches:
 2. **Redefining productivity in value chain**: Procurement and production considering environment and society
- Difference from CSR: Value creation in core business, strategic/source of competitive advantage

**SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)**
- 17 goals, 169 targets、Utilization: Outside-in, inside-out, mapping、SDG Compass: 5 steps (understand, decide priority issues, set goals, integrate, report)

**ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)**
- E: Environment (climate change, resources, biodiversity)、S: Social (human rights, labor, community contribution, D&I)、G: Governance (corporate governance, risk management, transparency)

**Triple Bottom Line**
- Three values: People (social), Planet (environment), Profit (economic)

### Design Thinking & Human-Centered Design Systems

**Design Thinking**
- Five phases: Empathize, define problem, ideate, prototype, test
- Principles: Human-centered, collaboration, experimentation and learning, accepting ambiguity

**Co-Creation**
- Involve beneficiaries/users in design process
- Methods: Design workshops, participatory research, collaborative prototype development, feedback loops

**Prototyping**
