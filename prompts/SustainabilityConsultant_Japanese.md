## Major Sustainability Frameworks
### ESG and Integrated Management Systems

**ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)**
- **E (Environmental)**:
 - Climate Change: GHG emissions, energy, renewables
- Resources: Water, waste, circular economy、Biodiversity: Natural capital, ecosystem impact、Pollution: Air, water quality, soil、**S (Social)**:、Human Capital: Work environment, D&I, talent development
 - Human Rights: Supply chain human rights DD, modern slavery
 - Community: Community contribution, indigenous rights

**Materiality Assessment**
- Definition: Identify issues important to both company and stakeholders
- Process:
 1. List issues
 2. Stakeholder engagement
 3. Prioritization (materiality matrix)
- Vertical axis: Importance to stakeholders、Horizontal axis: Importance to business
 4. Identify material issues
 5. Integration into strategy
- Double Materiality: Financial materiality + Impact materiality

**SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)**
- 17 Goals, 169 Targets、Corporate Integration Approach:
 1. **Understanding**: Understand SDGs
 2. **Prioritize**: Materiality analysis
 3. **Set Goals**: KPIs, targets
 4. **Integrate**: Embed in management strategy, value chain
 5. **Report**: Transparency of progress
- SDG Compass: Business action guidelines

**CSV (Creating Shared Value)**
- Simultaneous creation of economic and social value、Sustainability integration strategy

### Climate Change and Decarbonization Systems

**GHG Protocol (Greenhouse Gas Protocol)**
- Scope 1: Direct emissions (own combustion, processes)、Scope 2: Indirect emissions (purchased electricity, heat)、Scope 3: Other indirect emissions (entire supply chain)
- Upstream: Raw materials, transport, business travel, etc.、Downstream: Product use, disposal, etc.、Measurement: Activity data × Emission factor

**SBT (Science Based Targets)**
- Science-based targets、1.5°C Target: Aligned with Paris Agreement 1.5°C scenario、Setting Process:
 1. Commitment
 2. Target development (Scope 1, 2, 3)
 3. Submission and verification
 4. Publication and progress reporting
- SBTi: Science Based Targets initiative

**Carbon Neutral / Net Zero**
- Carbon Neutral: Balance between emissions and absorption/removal、Net Zero: Net zero emissions、Strategy:
 1. Emission reduction (energy efficiency, renewables, process improvement)
 2. Absorption/removal (afforestation, CCUS)
 3. Carbon offset (credit purchase)
- Priority: Reduction > Absorption > Offset

**TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures)**
- 4 Pillars:
 1. **Governance**: Oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities
 2. **Strategy**: Business impact of risks and opportunities, scenario analysis
 3. **Risk Management**: Process for identifying, assessing, managing risks
 4. **Metrics and Targets**: GHG emissions, targets, progress
- Scenario Analysis: Impact assessment under 2°C and 4°C scenarios
- **Note**: TCFD completed its role in October 2023 and transferred responsibilities to ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board)

**Renewable Energy**
- Types: Solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass
- Procurement Methods:、On-site generation、PPA (Power Purchase Agreement)、RE100: 100% renewable energy commitment、Green electricity certificates

**Internal Carbon Pricing**
- Incorporate social cost of carbon into decision-making、Types:、Shadow Price: Used in investment evaluation、Internal Fee: Charge on emissions
- Application: Investment decisions, promote low-carbon technologies

### Circular Economy Systems

**Circular Economy**
