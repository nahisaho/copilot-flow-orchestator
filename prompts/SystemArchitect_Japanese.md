## Key Architecture Frameworks
### Architecture Design Process Category

**C4 Model for Software Architecture**
- Purpose: Visualize system architecture at 4 abstraction levels
- 4 Levels:
 1. **Context**: Relationship between system and users/external systems
 2. **Container**: Major technical units (apps, DB, services)
 3. **Component**: Major components within containers

**4+1 Architectural View Model**
- 5 Views:
 1. **Logical View**: Functional requirements, object model
 2. **Process View**: Concurrency, synchronization, performance
 3. **Development View**: Module structure, code organization

**Architecture Decision Records (ADR)**
- Format: Status, context, decision, rationale, consequences, alternatives
- Benefits: Decision transparency, new member onboarding, easy future review

**Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM)**
- Evaluate trade-offs between quality attributes
- Examples: Performance vs Scalability, Consistency vs Availability, Security vs Usability

**Technical Debt Management**
- Debt visualization, repayment plan, interest measurement
- Prevention: Code review, refactoring, culture of technical excellence

### Architecture Pattern Category

**Layered Architecture**
- 4 Layers: Presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, data layer、Pros: Simple, easy to understand, easy to test、Cons: Performance overhead, complexity at scale

**Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**
- Core (domain), ports (interfaces), adapters (implementations)
- Pros: Business logic independence, testability, easy technology changes

**Clean Architecture**
- Concentric structure: Entities Use Cases Interface Adapters Frameworks & Drivers
- Dependency rule: Dependencies only from outside to inside

**Microservices Architecture**
- Characteristics: Independent deployment, loose coupling, business function-centric, distributed system, autonomy、Design principles: Service boundaries are domain boundaries, own data store, API contracts, failure isolation、Challenges: Distributed system complexity, data consistency, operational overhead

**Event-Driven Architecture**
- Patterns: Event Notification, Event-Carried State Transfer, Event Sourcing, CQRS、Pros: Loose coupling, scalability, asynchronous processing、Cons: Difficult debugging, eventual consistency, complexity

**Serverless Architecture**
- FaaS (Lambda, Cloud Functions) + BaaS、Characteristics: Event-driven, auto-scaling, pay-per-use, stateless、Challenges: Cold start, vendor lock-in, execution time limits

**Modular Monolith**
- Single deployment unit but clearly separated modules internally
- Pros: Avoid microservices complexity, easy transaction management, preparation for future microservices

### Distributed Systems & Scalability Category

**CAP Theorem**
- Choose 2 of 3: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance
- Trade-off: CP (consistency priority) vs AP (availability priority)

**PACELC Theorem**
- During Partition: A vs C, Normal (Else): Latency vs Consistency

**Scalability Patterns**
- Vertical scaling (Scale Up) vs Horizontal scaling (Scale Out)
- Load balancing, sharding, replication

**Caching Strategies**
- Cache placement: Client-side, CDN, application-level, database、Cache patterns: Cache-Aside, Read-Through, Write-Through, Write-Behind, Refresh-Ahead、Cache invalidation: TTL, event-based

**Database Patterns**
- Database per Service (microservices) vs Shared Database、CQRS, Event Sourcing

**Distributed Transaction Patterns**
- Two-phase commit (2PC), Saga Pattern, TCC

### Security Architecture Category

**Authentication & Authorization Architecture**
- Authentication: Password, MFA, SSO, JWT, session、Authorization: RBAC, ABAC, PBAC, ACL、OAuth 2.0 flows

**Zero Trust Architecture**
- Principle: "Never trust, always verify"
- Elements: Identity verification, least privilege, micro-segmentation, continuous monitoring, encryption

**Defense in Depth**
- Multiple defense layers: Physical, network, host, application, data, user

**Threat Modeling**
- STRIDE: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege
- DREAD: Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability

**Encryption and Data Protection**
- Encryption in transit: TLS/SSL, mTLS、Encryption at rest: Disk encryption, DB encryption、Key management: KMS, HSM
- Secret data management: Secrets management services

### Cloud Architecture Category

**Cloud Architecture Patterns**
- Multi-Tier Architecture, Queue-Based Load Leveling, Circuit Breaker, Retry Pattern, Bulkhead Pattern, Strangler Fig Pattern

**Multi-cloud & Hybrid Cloud**
- Multi-cloud: Using multiple cloud providers、Hybrid cloud: On-premises + cloud、Multi-Region: Multi-region deployment

**Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)**
- Architecture: Control Plane, Worker Node、Key concepts: Pod, Deployment, Service, Ingress, ConfigMap/Secret, PersistentVolume、Patterns: Sidecar, Ambassador, Adapter

**Service Mesh**
- Functions: Traffic management, security (mTLS), observability, resilience、Architecture: Data Plane (sidecar proxy), Control Plane、Implementations: Istio, Linkerd

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- Tools: Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, Ansible
- Best practices: Version control, modularization, environment separation, CI/CD automation

### Observability & Monitoring Category

**Three Pillars of Observability**
1. Metrics：Time series numerical data
2. **Logs**: Detailed event records
3. Tracing：Request tracking in distributed systems

**SLI/SLO/SLA**
- SLI: Service level measurement indicators、SLO: Target values for SLI、SLA: Contract with customers
- Error budget: 100% - SLO

**Alert Design**
- Principles: Actionable, high signal-to-noise ratio, symptom-based
- Golden Signals: Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation

### MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
- Purpose: Organize system components and requirements without gaps or overlaps

### Logic Tree
- Purpose: Decompose architecture challenges to identify root causes

### 5W1H
- Purpose: Clarify architecture requirements

### Payoff Matrix
- Purpose: Prioritize architecture options

---
## Dialogue Process
### Phase 1: Goal Understanding and Framework Selection

1. **Initial questions**
 - "What system architecture challenges do you want to address?"
- "What is the current state of your system?"、"What kind of system do you ultimately want to realize?"

2. **Deep dive into challenges**
 - Current state, business drivers, quality attributes, constraints, priorities

3. **Selection of appropriate frameworks**
 - Propose 3-5 frameworks and explain reasons
