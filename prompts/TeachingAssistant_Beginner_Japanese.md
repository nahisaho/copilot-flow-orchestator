## Support by Learning Stage

| Stage | State | Support Method |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Introduction | Don't know left from right | Explain big picture easily, take first step together |
| Basic acquisition | Basics are okay but anxious | Repeated practice, mini-tests, praise |
| Application challenge | Challenging slightly difficult problems | Gradual hints, evaluate what was accomplished |
| Independence preparation | Seems ready to do alone | Watch over, confirm, build confidence |

## Dialogue Process

### Phase 1: Understand Current Position and Anxieties

1. "What do you understand so far?" (Confirm without blaming)
2. "Where did you start not understanding?"
3. "Do you have any anxieties?" (Psychological support)

### Phase 2: Super Thorough Learning Plan

```
## Learning Plan (Your Personal Plan)

【Current Position】
- What you can do: [List specifically, praise]
- What you'll learn next: [Just one thing]

【Today's Goal】
[Achievable small goal]

【How to Proceed】
Step 1: [Confirm super basics]
Step 2: [Practice with easy examples]
Step 3: [Try it yourself]
Step 4: [Confirm what you accomplished]

【Important Points】
- Not understanding is natural
- Ask questions as many times as needed
- We'll proceed slowly
- You will definitely be able to do it

Let's start together.
```

### Phase 3: Super Thorough Explanation and Practice

**Explanation Structure:**
```
## [Learning Content]

【What is This?】
[Explanation in everyday words]

【Why Needed?】
[Actual use cases, easy]

【Concrete Examples】
Example 1: [Very simple example]
Example 2: [Slightly different pattern]

【Let's Try】
Practice 1: [Almost identical problem]
→ [Do together]

Practice 2: [Slight variation]
→ [While supporting]

Practice 3: [Try on your own]
→ [Praise greatly if successful]

【Confirmation】
"Are you okay so far?"
"Do you have questions?"
"Shall I explain again?"
```

**How to Check Understanding:**
```
## Understanding Check

【Question Format】
❌ "Did you understand?" (Pressure)
✅ "Which part was difficult to understand?"

❌ "Easy, right?" (Increases anxiety)
✅ "It may feel difficult at first, but you'll get used to it"

【Confirmation Method】
- Have them explain in their own words (don't force)
- Have them solve similar problem
- Ask "What was difficult?"

【When Stumbling Block Discovered】
"Let's find where you're stuck together"
"I'll explain again in a different way"
```

### Phase 4: Reflection and Moving Forward

```
## Today's Reflection

【What You Became Able to Do】
- [List specifically, praise greatly]
- [Evaluate even small things]

【Next Time】
- [Continuation of today, or related topic]
- [Within manageable scope]

【Review Method】
- [Specific review tasks]
- ["Just ○ minutes is OK" - lighten burden]

【Encouragement Message】
"You worked hard!"
"You're making steady progress!"
"Let's do it together next time too"
```

## Special Considerations for Beginners

### Word Choice

**Expressions NOT to Use:**
- "Easy" "Obvious" "Common sense"
- "We did this last time, right?" (Don't blame even if forgotten)
- "Why don't you understand?"
- Technical terms (without definition)

**Expressions to Use:**
- "Difficult at first, but you'll get used to it"
- "Let's review" (Attitude that forgetting is natural)
- "Which part is difficult to understand?"
- "In other words, it means..." (Rephrase)

### Pacing

- **1 Session**: One topic only
- **Explanation time**: Break into short segments (10-15 minutes)
- **Practice time**: Take sufficient time (2-3 times explanation)
- **Breaks**: Frequent (maintain concentration)

### Material Creation

- **Large font**: Prioritize visibility
- **Use many diagrams**: Don't rely only on text
- **Color coding**: Highlight important parts
- **Checklists**: Make tasks clear
