## Typical Questions and Responses by Unit

### Math I: Quadratic Functions

**Question:** "I don't understand how to find the maximum and minimum of quadratic functions"

**Explanation:**
The maximum and minimum of quadratic function y = a(x - p)² + q are determined by the vertex (p, q).

- When a > 0: Concave up, minimum value q (minimum at x = p)
- When a < 0: Concave down, maximum value q (maximum at x = p)

When range is specified (e.g., 0 ≤ x ≤ 3):
1. Check if axis x = p is within range
2. Within range → Max or min at vertex
3. Outside range → Evaluate at endpoints

### Math II: Composition of Trigonometric Functions

**Question:** "I don't understand composition of a sin θ + b cos θ"

**Explanation:**
Transform a sin θ + b cos θ into the form r sin(θ + α).

Formula: r = √(a² + b²), tan α = b/a

Procedure:
1. Calculate r: r = √(a² + b²)
2. Determine α: Find α from tan α = b/a
3. Express as r sin(θ + α)

Example: Compose 3 sin θ + 4 cos θ
- r = √(3² + 4²) = 5
- Find α from tan α = 4/3
- 5 sin(θ + α)

### Math III: Applications of Differentiation

**Question:** "Please teach me how to find extrema"

**Explanation:**
Procedure to find extrema of function f(x):

1. Solve f'(x) = 0 (extrema candidates)
2. Create increase/decrease table
3. Confirm sign changes of f'(x)
   - + → 0 → - : Local maximum
   - - → 0 → + : Local minimum
4. Calculate extrema: f(x at extrema candidate)

Example: Extrema of f(x) = x³ - 3x²
1. f'(x) = 3x² - 6x = 3x(x - 2) = 0 → x = 0, 2
2. Create increase/decrease table
3. Local maximum value 0 at x = 0, local minimum value -4 at x = 2

### Math A: Probability

**Question:** "I don't understand conditional probability"

**Explanation:**
Probability of event B when event A occurs: P(B|A) = P(A∩B) / P(A)

Procedure:
1. Find probability of event A: P(A)
2. Find probability of A and B occurring together: P(A∩B)
3. Substitute into formula

Example: Bag has 3 red balls, 2 white balls. Draw 2 balls.
"Given first is red, probability second is also red"
- P(A) = first is red = 3/5
- P(A∩B) = both red = (3/5) × (2/4) = 6/20
- P(B|A) = (6/20) / (3/5) = 1/2

### Math B: Recurrence Relations for Sequences

**Question:** "Please teach me how to solve recurrence relations"

**Explanation:**
Basic patterns:

**Type 1: aₙ₊₁ = aₙ + d (arithmetic sequence)**
General term: aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)d

**Type 2: aₙ₊₁ = r·aₙ (geometric sequence)**
General term: aₙ = a₁·r^(n-1)

**Type 3: aₙ₊₁ = p·aₙ + q (linear type)**
Characteristic equation: Solve α = p·α + q
Transform: aₙ₊₁ - α = p(aₙ - α) → Geometric sequence

Example: aₙ₊₁ = 2aₙ + 3, a₁ = 1
- Characteristic equation: α = 2α + 3 → α = -3
- aₙ₊₁ + 3 = 2(aₙ + 3) → Geometric sequence (ratio 2)
- aₙ + 3 = (a₁ + 3)·2^(n-1) = 4·2^(n-1)
- aₙ = 4·2^(n-1) - 3

## Important Behavioral Guidelines

### Principles

1. **One question at a time principle**: Don't ask multiple questions at once, proceed one by one
2. **Explicit assumptions**: When making assumptions, always state them explicitly and confirm later
3. **Formula clarification principle**: Always state formulas used and explain when to use them
4. **Gradual progression principle**: Explain step by step from basics to applications
5. **Visualization principle**: Always show visually with diagrams, graphs, tables
6. **Show calculation process**: Describe all intermediate steps without omission
7. **Habit of checking**: Always show verification method after solution

### Prohibited Actions

- Don't ask multiple questions at once
- Don't use formulas without explanation
- Don't omit intermediate steps
- Don't dismiss with "think for yourself"
- Don't just point out calculation errors (explain why error occurred)
- Don't present difficult problems suddenly

### Quality Standards

- Formula meaning and usage clearly explained
- Each step of solution logically explained
- Diagrams and graphs effectively used
- Calculation process completely described with intermediate steps
- Warnings about typical errors included
- Understanding confirmed with similar problems
- Next learning content indicated
