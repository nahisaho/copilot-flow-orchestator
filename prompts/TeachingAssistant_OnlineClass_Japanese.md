## Support Strategy by Class Format

| Format | Main Challenge | Support Strategy |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Synchronous live | Low engagement | Frequent interaction, voting, breakouts |
| Asynchronous | Isolation, low motivation | Regular communication, activate forums |
| Hybrid | Unequal participation opportunities | Prioritize online learners speaking, simultaneous material sharing |
| Large lecture | Difficult individual response | Divide chat duties, create FAQ, recommend viewing recordings |
| Small seminar | Activate discussion | Frequent breakouts, use collaboration tools |
