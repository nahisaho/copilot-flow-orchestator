## Urban Planning & Community Development Framework System
### Basic Urban Planning Methods

**Compact City Strategy**
- Purpose: Sustainable urban structure, Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)、Principles: High density, mixed use, public transportation access、Elements: Urban hub consolidation, public transportation network, walkability
- Effects: Infrastructure efficiency, reduced travel time, CO2 reduction
- Application: Depopulating cities, suburban sprawl countermeasures, new development

**New Urbanism**
- Purpose: Human-scale community development, community formation、Principles: Walkability, mixed use, traditional design, emphasis on public space、Elements: Street-oriented architecture, grid streets, plazas and parks
- Effects: Neighborhood communities, promotion of walking and cycling
- Application: Residential development, old town regeneration, suburban redevelopment

**Smart City**
- Purpose: Urban function optimization using ICT、Elements: IoT sensors, data analysis, automated systems、Fields: Traffic management, energy, disaster prevention, administrative services
- Effects: Efficiency, convenience improvement, environmental burden reduction
- Application: New development, digitalization of existing cities

**Resilient City Design**
- Purpose: Adaptation to disasters and climate change、Elements: Disaster prevention infrastructure, evacuation plans, redundancy, flexibility、Countermeasures: Flood measures (retention basins, permeable pavement), seismic reinforcement, green infrastructure
- Effects: Disaster damage mitigation, early recovery
- Application: Disaster prevention planning, infrastructure renewal, coastal development

### Land Use Planning

**Zoning**
- Residential: Low-rise residential, mid-high-rise residential, exclusively residential、Commercial: Neighborhood commercial, commercial districts、Industrial: Semi-industrial, exclusively industrial
- Mixed use: Vitality through use mixing
- Application: Regulations based on City Planning Act, development permission

**Land Use Conversion Strategy**
- Use change: Industrial site Commercial/residential, farmland residential、Renovation: Existing building use change, renovation、Site reuse: Reuse of school/hospital sites
- Deregulation: Special zones, urban regeneration special districts
- Application: Industrial structure transformation, depopulating regions

**Density Management**
- Floor Area Ratio: Upper limit of buildable total floor area、Building Coverage Ratio: Ratio of building area to site area、Height restrictions: Absolute height, setback restrictions
- Strategy: High density around stations, low density in residential areas - creating contrast
- Application: Urban area formation, landscape preservation

### Transportation Planning

**Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)**
- Principle: High-density development within walking distance of stations (radius 500-800m)、Elements: Station plazas, bus connections, bicycle parking, commercial facilities、Effects: Promoting public transportation use, reducing automobile dependency
- Application: Station area development, new rail line development

**Road Network Design**
- Hierarchical structure: Arterial roads, supplementary arterial roads, local roads、Grid vs radial-ring: Selection according to urban structure、Pedestrian-vehicle separation: Pedestrian-only streets, transit malls
- Bicycle network: Bicycle lanes, bicycle parking
- Application: Transportation planning, road improvement plans

**Transportation Demand Management (TDM)**
- Road pricing: Congestion charging, parking fees、Park & Ride: Public transportation from suburban parking lots、Car sharing & bike sharing: Vehicle sharing
- Telework: Commute reduction、Effects: Traffic congestion relief, CO2 reduction、Application: City centers, tourist areas

### Regional Revitalization Methods

**Placemaking**
- Purpose: Enhancing attractiveness of public spaces, community formation、Methods: Plaza utilization, street furniture, event hosting、Principles: Resident participation, experimental approach, flexibility
- Effects: Increased dwell time, regional attachment, economic revitalization
- Application: Park development, station plazas, shopping street revitalization

**Tactical Urbanism**
- Definition: Small-scale, short-term, low-cost urban interventions、Methods: Temporary benches, street painting, pop-up stores、Process: Experiment Evaluate Improve Permanentize
- Effects: Rapid implementation, resident participation, risk reduction
- Application: Creating pedestrian spaces, social experiments

**Area Management**
- Definition: Maintaining and improving favorable environment and value in areas、Entities: BID (Business Improvement District), TMO, community development companies、Activities: Cleaning/beautification, events, promotion, regulatory guidance
- Funding: Landowner contributions, beneficiary charges, public support
- Application: Urban revitalization, redevelopment districts

**Creative City Strategy**
- Purpose: Creative industry clustering, urban branding、Elements: Artist attraction, cultural facilities, creative spaces (studios, co-working)、Effects: Innovation, tourism attraction, youth retention
- Examples: Art districts, design districts, media industry clustering
- Application: Industrial transformation, urban regeneration

### Resident Participation & Consensus Building

**Participatory Planning Process**
- Workshops: Resident idea generation, issue sharing、Town meetings: Briefings, opinion exchange、Questionnaire surveys: Understanding resident intentions
- Councils: Participation of diverse stakeholders
- Application: Master plan formulation, redevelopment planning

**Co-Design Methods**
- Definition: Collaborative design by experts and residents、Process: Current situation analysis Vision sharing Idea generation Plan formulation、Tools: Models, sketches, digital tools
- Effects: Resident acceptance, reflecting regional needs、Application: Park design, public facility planning

**Consensus Building Techniques**
- Mediation: Neutral mediator facilitating dialogue、Consensus building: Exploring solutions everyone accepts、Interest coordination: Building Win-Win relationships
- Information disclosure: Ensuring transparency, building trust
- Application: Interest conflicts, redevelopment opposition movements

### Sustainability

**Green Infrastructure**
- Definition: Infrastructure utilizing natural functions、Elements: Street trees, rooftop greening, rain gardens, biotopes、Effects: Stormwater management, heat island mitigation, biodiversity, landscape
- Application: Climate change adaptation, environmental burden reduction

**Circular Economy City**
- Principles: Resource circulation, zero waste、Elements: Recycling facilities, sharing, refurbishing、Effects: Resource efficiency, CO2 reduction, new industry creation
- Application: Industrial parks, environmental future cities

**Carbon Neutral City**
- Strategy: Energy conservation, renewable energy, CO2 absorption、Elements: ZEB (Zero Energy Building), renewable energy introduction, public transportation、Indicators: CO2 emissions, energy consumption
- Application: Environmentally advanced cities, new development
