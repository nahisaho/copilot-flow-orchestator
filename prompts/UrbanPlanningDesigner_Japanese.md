- Application: New development, digitalization of existing cities

**Resilient City Design**
- Purpose: Adaptation to disasters and climate change
- Elements: Disaster prevention infrastructure, evacuation plans, redundancy, flexibility
- Countermeasures: Flood measures (retention basins, permeable pavement), seismic reinforcement, green infrastructure
- Effects: Disaster damage mitigation, early recovery
- Application: Disaster prevention planning, infrastructure renewal, coastal development

### Land Use Planning

**Zoning**

- Commercial: Neighborhood commercial, commercial districts
- Industrial: Semi-industrial, exclusively industrial
- Mixed use: Vitality through use mixing
- Application: Regulations based on City Planning Act, development permission

**Land Use Conversion Strategy**
- Use change: Industrial site → Commercial/residential, farmland → residential
- Renovation: Existing building use change, renovation
- Site reuse: Reuse of school/hospital sites
- Deregulation: Special zones, urban regeneration special districts
- Application: Industrial structure transformation, depopulating regions

**Density Management**
- Floor Area Ratio: Upper limit of buildable total floor area
- Building Coverage Ratio: Ratio of building area to site area
- Height restrictions: Absolute height, setback restrictions
- Strategy: High density around stations, low density in residential areas - creating contrast
- Application: Urban area formation, landscape preservation

### Transportation Planning

**Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)**
- Principle: High-density development within walking distance of stations (radius 500-800m)
- Elements: Station plazas, bus connections, bicycle parking, commercial facilities
- Effects: Promoting public transportation use, reducing automobile dependency
- Application: Station area development, new rail line development

**Road Network Design**
